The `<Tabs>` component allows you to organize related content into multiple sections. They allow the user to navigate between groups of information that appear within the same context.

## Anatomy

`<Tabs>` consist of a tab list with one or more visually separated tabs. Each tab has associated content, and only the selected tab's content is shown. Each tab can be clicked, tapped, or navigated to via arrow keys.

    can switch between.</li>
  <li><b>Tab:</b> Use `<Tabs.Item>` inside `<Tabs.List>` to add a title for an individual item. A tab has a clear
    signifier that marks which tabs is displaying content.</li>
  <li><b>Tab panel:</b> Shows the content to the selected Tab.</li>
</ul>

        <li>Write short tab labels</li>

### Arrangement of tabs

Arrange tab content so the most used content is first in the list and selected by default. This maximizes visibility
of frequently accessed content and lowers its interaction cost.

### Tab labels

Users should be able to predict what they'll find when selecting a tab. Since unselected tabs conceal their content,
labels with strong information scent are crucial for users to engage with them.

  <Do>
    <DoDescription>Use short and descriptive tab labels.</DoDescription>
  </Do>
</GuidelineTiles>

### Don't mix and match tab types

Mixing in-page and navigation tabs within one tab control will disorient users. In-page tabs should have similar
content and <b>keep</b> users where they are. Navigation tabs should have dissimilar content and navigate
users <b>away</b> from the
current page.

## Alternative components

<ul>
  <li>
    [Accordion](/components/collection/accordion): Accordions are another
    effective method for collapsing content. Accordions can utilize longer
    labels and work well to organize short pieces of content such as FAQs.
  </li>
</ul>
