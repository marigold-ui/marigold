The `useTheme` is a hook that gets you the current theme and all of its attributes and properties.

The `useTheme` hook returns the current `theme`, if there isn't a theme it uses the `defaultTheme`

```tsx
const theme = useTheme();
```

## Import

To import the hook you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { useTheme } from '@marigold/system';
```
