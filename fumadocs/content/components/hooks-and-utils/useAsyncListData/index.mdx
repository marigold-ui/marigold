title: useAsyncListData
description: Hook that returns async data
---

We use the `useAsyncListData` hook from [`react-spectrum stately package`](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/tree/main/packages/%40react-stately). It extends the `useListData` which is also from `react-spectrum`.

It supports async loading, pagination, sorting and filtering.
It also manages loading and error states, supports abortable requests and works with any data fetchig library or the built-in browser fetch API.

More information can be found in the [react-spectrum documentation](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/useAsyncList.html).

## Import

```tsx
import { useAsyncListData } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Examples

### Async Table

This is an example from the [`<Table>`](/components/table/) component. The data will be loaded asynchronously.
