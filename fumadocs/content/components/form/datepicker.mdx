The `<DatePicker>` component is a user interface element that allows users to select a date from a calendar.

The typical practice is to provide a date picker and when you click on calendar button it pops up a calendar below the date field, allowing the user to populate the field with an appropriate date.

## Anatomy

The Label defines the purpose of the Date Field, where users can enter a date directly. Tapping the Calendar Button opens a calendar view with a Header for selecting the month and year, and Next/Previous Buttons for easy month navigation.

## Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={'DatePicker'} />

## Usage

`<DatePicker>` is used when you need users to select a date accurately, like for booking events, scheduling appointments, or setting deadlines. It's ideal when date formats might vary, as it standardizes input and reduces mistakes because its visual clarity, format consistency and accuracy. DatePickers are also helpful when users might need guidance on valid date ranges, like selecting only future dates for reservations. Avoid using it for casual date entries where a simple text field would suffice.

### Basic Usage (uncontrolled)

This example shows a regular `<DatePicker>` without any special props.

<ComponentDemo name="date-picker-basic" />

### Min/Max Values

The `minValue` and `maxValue` props are used to perform built-in validation. This prevents the user from selecting dates outside the valid range in the calendar .

<ComponentDemo name="date-picker-min-max" />

### Controlled

The `value` and `onChange` props can be used to control the `DatePicker`.

<ComponentDemo name="date-picker-controlled" />

### Using a Date Object

When using a datepicker, relying on the standard JavaScript `Date` object for its value can result in timezone inconsistencies and incorrect date display. That's why the datepicker uses a specific `DateValue` type from [@internationalized/date](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/) instead. This library handles correct international date manipulation across calendars, time zones, and other localization concerns.

<Callout title="@internationalized/date" type="info">
  `@internationalized/date` is a peer dependency. If it's not already in your
  project, you'll need to install it.
</Callout>

The simplest way to parse a Date for the datepicker is by using `parseAbsoluteToLocal`. This function converts an absolute date and time into the current user's local time zone.
If you're already using a date library like [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/), you can also utilizing `parseDate`. Ensure that you only pass the date part to `parseDate`, excluding the time and timezone information.

### Paste Support

The `<DatePicker>` supports pasting date values from the clipboard. Users can copy dates in common formats and paste them directly into the date picker field. The component automatically parses and validates the pasted content.

**Supported date formats:**

- ISO format: `2023-12-25`
- European format: `25.12.2023` or `25/12/2023`
- US format: `12/25/2023` or `12-25-2023`

Invalid dates or unrecognized formats are ignored, ensuring data integrity.
