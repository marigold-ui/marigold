Happy New Year! 🥳 Marigold v10.1.2 kicks off the year with updates to key components and the introduction of a brand-new component. Along with that we made a lot of dependency updates including changing the React version to React 19. Thanks for being part of the journey—we’re excited for what’s ahead.

Here’s what’s new!

## Improvements

- **React 19:** We have updated to React 19, bringing enhanced performance, streamlined simplicity, and an improved development experience.

### Components

- **Pagination:** We added a new component `<Pagination>` to the Marigold library. This component is used to divide and navigate large data sets. You can find more information about this component in the documentation.
- **SectionMessage:** You now have the possibility to control the dismissable `<SectionMessage>` we've added the properties `close` and `onCloseChange` to handle the dismissable state.
- **XLoader:** The `<XLoader>` was refactored and is now more accessible! Besides this the docs page were updated.

### Documentation

We of course also keep on updating our component documentation pages. These following pages have been updated:

- `<Aspect>`
- `<Calendar>`
- `<Inset>`
- `<Grid>`
- `<SearchField>`
- `<Tiles>`
