    },
    {
      property: 'collapseAt',
      description:
        'Collapse children into a vertical layout at given width. Note that `collapseAt` is based on the total element width, and not the window width. With a default value of "0em" columns will not collapse by default.',
      type: 'string | number',
      default: '0em',
    },

## Examples

### Columns and a space between them

The example shows how to use the `space` prop. It defines the gap between the contents.

```tsx preview file=components/Columns/space-columns.demo.tsx

```

### Columns collapsing at a certain width

The example show how the `collapseAt` prop is to use. If you resize the window of your browser you can see that the columns are collapsing or expanding. Please note that the collapsing or expanding starting in a small range of the `collapseAt` value.

```tsx preview file=components/Columns/collapse-columns.demo.tsx

```

### Page layout

Create a page layout with three columns and collapse or expanding at `25em`

```tsx preview file=components/Columns/layout-columns.demo.tsx

```

### Stretch to Height of Parent

By using the `stretch` prop you can make the container to take full width. Note that this is usually not necessary since the columns will expand with their children anyway.

```tsx preview file=components/Columns/stretch-columns.demo.tsx

```

Here is another interactive example on how to use the `stretch` prop. Note that there has to be a parent of the columns that sets a `height`. Otherwhise setting the height in a column to `100%` will not have any effect.

```tsx preview file=components/Columns/stretch-columns-switch.demo.tsx

```
