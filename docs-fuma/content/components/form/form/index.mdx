The `<Form>` component acts as a container for a set of fields, enabling data transmission to a server. It operates like a standard HTML form, initiating either a request based on the specified `method` attribute.

Additionally, the `<Form>` allows to validate user input and offers feedback for incorrect data entries, enhancing the overall resilience and user-friendliness of the form submission process. See the [Validation](/foundations/validation) guide to learn more about form validation.

## Import

```tsx
import { Form } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Props

<PropsTable component="Form" />
## Examples ### Setup

This is a simple setup how to use a `<Form>`.

<ComponentPreview name="form-base" />

### Handling submission

The `onSubmit` event is useful for custom form actions, such as calling a REST API, instead of relying on the native form submission. It triggeres when a user submits the form using the Enter key or clicks the submit button. The `onReset` event is triggered when a user presses a reset button (`[type=reset]`).

<ComponentPreview name="form-submission" />

### Server Errors

The `<Form>` component handles passed errors, typically received from a server after form submission. To display validation errors, set the `validationErrors` prop as an object mapping each field's name prop to a string or array of strings representing errors. These errors appear to the user as soon as the `validationErrors` prop is set and are cleared when the user modifies the corresponding field's value.

<ComponentPreview name="form-validation-errors" />

For more information about form validation, see the [Validation](/foundations/validation) guide.

### Focus Management

As you can see in the previous server errors example, when a user submits a form with validation errors, the first invalid field is automatically focused. This behavior can be customized using `e.preventDefault` during the `onInvalid` event and manage the focus manually.

<ComponentPreview name="form-focus-management" />
