title: Autocomplete
description: A searchfield that displays a dynamic list of suggestions.
---

The `<Autocomplete>` component is an input field that offers suggestions for the user's input as they type. These proposals are based on a predefined set of options.

It also helps to reduce the effort and time required to input data and to avoid errors that can occur due to typos or misspellings. The suggestions are displayed in a combobox list, and the user can select one of the options or continue typing their own input.

## Anatomy

Autocomplete is made up of a form input field, label, and overlay of menu options. The label and description aren't required and may be visually hidden. The clear button is shown after typing starts.

  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Help text:</b> Supplementary information displayed below the input field
    to assist users in filling out the form correctly. Can also be an
    errormessage.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Clear button:</b> A button that allows users to quickly remove all text
    from the input field.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Dropdown arrow:</b> An icon indicating that more options are available;
    clicking it reveals a list of selectable items.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Overlay:</b> Hold a list of all possible options which can be selected.
  </li>
</ul>

## Usage

Use an autocomplete search field (also known as a predictive search) to help users find what they’re looking for faster.
An autocomplete search field displays suggestions as someone types into the field, just like the Google search bar.
It is also suitable for fields where people know what they’re looking for, e.g. country of birth, a particular event, or a particular city.

### Text label

The label of the `<Autocomplete>` provides a clear and concise description of its purpose, making it easier for users to
interact with the interface and understand it.
Always display a label unless the `<Autocomplete>` is next to another component which already has a label.

### Item content

Consider the width of the Autocomplete and keep the names of the options short and compact so that they fit. Long
item
names that occupy multiple lines are hard to perceive and should be avoided.

### Async Loading

- Large datasets that would be inefficient to load all at once
- API-backed search where results come from a server
- Dynamic filtering where options change based on input

The `useAsyncListData` hook provides built-in support for async loading, handling request states, cancellation, and filtering automatically. When implementing async loading.

### With sections

When related options are present, organizing them into sections enhances clarity and usability. Grouping options provides additional context and helps users navigate choices more easily. This approach reduces complexity and allows for additional guidance when needed, ensuring a more intuitive experience.

This can be achieved by wrapping the options in the `<Autocomplete.Section>` component. A header is required for each section, which is set using the `header` prop.
