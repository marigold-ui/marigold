The `<Grid>` component is a versatile tool to arrange child elements within a two-dimensional grid structure ([CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout)).

## Usage

`<Grid>` allows full control over columns and rows sizes, spacing between children, and the overall height. It is highly customizable, so that the `<Grid>` can be used optimally for complex layouts.

One of the benefits of using `<Grid>` is that its associated component, `<Grid.Area>`, don't need to be arranged in any specific order. They will be automatically positioned based on their `name` prop. If you'd like to understand more about how grid template areas function, you can find a detailed article [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/understanding-css-grid-template-areas/).
