The `<Breakout>` component is designed to help elements break out of their current container layout, creating visual interest and giving content the space it needs to stand out. Combine `<Breakout>` with the `<Container>` component to maintain a cohesive design while effectively drawing attention to important elements.

## Usage

Use the `<Breakout>` component when you need elements to break out of their current container layout, adding visual interest and giving content the space it needs to stand out.

It is particularly useful for situations where extra emphasis is needed or when you want to create a more dynamic and engaging reading experience. `<Breakout>` is ideal for highlighting media elements or other key content.

### Complex layouts

You can create more complex layouts within the `<Breakout>` component by combining it with other layout components. By nesting `<Inline>`, `<Stack>`, or `<Columns>` inside `<Breakout>`, you can design advanced, responsive structures that go beyond simple content.

Note that the `<Text>` component will still adhere to the content length defined by the `<Container>`.
