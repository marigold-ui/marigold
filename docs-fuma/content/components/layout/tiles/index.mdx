The `<Tiles>` is a layout component which is based on [CSS grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) system.

## Usage

`<Tiles>` serves as a versatile container, ideal for constructing panels, cards, lists, and other content components that organize and group information. They automatically wraps children to a new line if the space given is not enough to show the `<Tiles>` in one row.

It's possible to display the items with some spacing through `space` prop or set a minimum width for all items inside `<Tiles>` with `tilesWidth` prop.

<ComponentPreview name="tiles-complex" />

### Equal heights

If you need to have the items in the `<Tiles>` take the same height, you can use the `equalHeight` property, which is a boolean value that can be used to size the items of the `<Tiles>`. In this case, all items adopt the size of the largest card, making it essential when you want all items to match the largest child’s dimensions.

<ComponentPreview name="tiles-autoRows" />

### Stretch width

Using the `stretch` property will make the tiles fully responsive. Meaning, they will distribute available width between them while not getting smaller then the given `tilesWidth`.

<ComponentPreview name="tiles-stretch" />

## Props

<StorybookHintMessage />

<PropsTable component="Tiles" />

## Alternative components

<ul>
  <li>
    [Columns](/layout/columns/): It should be noted that `<Tiles>` is used for children with the same width. If you want to set different widths for the children use [`<Columns>`](/layout/columns/) instead.
</li>
  <li>
    [Grid](/layout/grid/): If you need more custom controll over the layout, you should use [`<Grid>`](/layout/grid/) component instead.
</li>
</ul>
