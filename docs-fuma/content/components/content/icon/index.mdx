This page explains how to use Marigold icons effectively.
Icons enhance visual appeal and help draw users’ attention. As a core element of the Marigold design system, they establish a consistent visual language across applications.

For a full list of the available Icons go to the [Marigold Icons](/foundations/icons/).

## Anatomy

The `<Icon>` component consists of an SVG element that represents the icon.

## Appearance

<AppearanceDemo component={'SVG'} />

<AppearanceTable component={'SVG'} />

## Usage

Icons are used to enhance the user interface by providing visual cues and improving the overall user experience. They can be used in buttons, links, or as standalone elements to represent actions, statuses, or concepts.
Icons should be used sparingly and only when they add value to the user interface. They should be easily recognizable and convey their meaning clearly without the need for additional text.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Icons should be used consistently throughout the application to
          maintain a cohesive design language.
        </li>
        <li>
          They should also be accessible, meaning that they should have
          appropriate alternative text or labels for screen readers.

      </ul>

      Icons should not be used as a replacement for text, but rather as a
      complement to it.

### Installation

The Marigold Icons are available as a package called `@marigold/icons`.
You can use them in your project by installing the package and importing the icons you need.

```bash
# with npm
npm install @marigold/icons --save

# with pnpm
pnpm add @marigold/icons
```

To import a specific component you just have to use the name of the icon directly between the `< />` brackets. E.g.:

```tsx
import { DesignTicket } from '@marigold/icons';

export default function MyComponent() {
  return <DesignTicket />;
}
```

You can also copy the SVG code directly from the [Marigold Icons](/foundations/icons/) page, but we recommend using the package for better maintainability and consistency.

### Icon size

You can change the size of the icon by using the `size` prop, you can set it to any valid CSS size value. It automatically sets the `width` and `height` of the SVG element.

<ComponentPreview name="icon-size" />

### Customize icon

Icons are build on our own [SVG component](../content/svg), which is based on the [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) standard. Meaning you can use all the attributes and properties that are available in the SVG standard.
