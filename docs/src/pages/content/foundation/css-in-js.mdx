## What's CSS-in-JS?

CSS-in-JS follows the principle of putting your CSS styles directly into your components instead of stylesheets.
You can write CSS in JavaScript syntax and take full advantage of the JS ecosystem.
Marigold uses the CSS-in-JS library called [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).
CSS-in-JS is actually a JavaScript library that bundles every JavaScript component with all associated CSS rules and dependencies.

## Why do we use CSS-in-JS?

### Scoped CSS

All CSS-in-JS libraries automatically generate unique names for CSS classes.
Styles applied in Marigold components are applied only to that component.
Styling outside the component is completely unaffected.
This prevents CSS classnames from colliding and reduces the effort required to find a suitable classname.

### No inline styles

With CSS-in-JS, no styles are assigned within the HTML. We do **not** use style props like `<div style={{ padding: '8px' }}>`.
This gives us the following advantages: Responsive designs, which are not possible with inline styles, can be used with CSS-in-JS.
Also, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements and media queries can be used.
In addition, inline styles are generally considered less performant than classnames.

### Server-Side-Rendering

The Marigold Design System is created using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and supports SSR.
During SSR, only the styles required to render the initial view are added to the HTML document. Dynamic styles are removed to reduce the amount of code.
This has a positive impact on performance, since no separate CSS file needs to be retrieved from the server to block the rendering process.

### The className property

Marigold theme styles are applied with a classname. Emotion outputs the classnames as a string, which can then be assigned to HTML elements like this:
`<button class='css-ase7ea css-1nt0tt7'>`.
The principle is to first define styles and then apply them to the component that is to be styled.

## What is CSS-in-JS not?

CSS-in-JS does not obviate the need to understand the following:

- How styles are applied to the DOM
- How inheritance works
- How CSS properties work
- How CSS layout works
