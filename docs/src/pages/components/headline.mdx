The main task of the `<Headline>` component is tot is to serve as a title of a content section.
It should be used when you want to structure different parts of informations. That could be the page title, text headings or the title of different content parts.

The component has a `level` property which behaves similar to the HTML Headings. There you can select a level from 1-6. Alternative you can set this with the `size` prop.
