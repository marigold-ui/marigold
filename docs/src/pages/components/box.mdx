caption: Learn about the foundation component of Marigold.
---

The `<Box>` component serves as the foundation of Marigold, acting as the bridge that connects the logic of components with their visual design. Through the use of `<Box>`, theme-based values can be bound to components and utilized for styling. Every component in Marigold is composed of `<Box>` components.

Ideally, you should not need this component frequently, unless you are building a design system component or a custom component that is specific to your app and you want to use the design tokens.

## Usage

### Import

To import the component you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { Box } from '@marigold/components';
```

### Props

<PropsTable
  props={[
    {
      property: 'as',
      type: 'HTMLElement | MarigoldComponent',
      description:
        'Behaves like a HTMLElement or a Marigold component if used.',
      default: 'div',
    },
    {
      property: 'css',
      type: 'CSSObject | CSSObject',
      description: 'Set CSS for the component.',
      default: '',
    },
    {
      property: '...',
      type: '',
      description: 'HTML attributes based on the rendered element.',
      default: '',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Examples

### Polymorphic Component

When using the `<Box>` component, it will render a div element by default. However, you have the option to customize this by using the `as` prop. All regular HTML props will be forwarded to the underlying element. Typescript will ensure that only correct HTML attributes are used by limiting the props based on the `as` prop. This polymorphic type inference will work not only with HTML elements, but also with any React component.

Using the `<Box>` element to render an element will also apply CSS normalization, ensuring that the element is displayed consistently across all browsers.

```tsx preview file=components/Box/box-as-button.demo.tsx

```

Passing another React component to the `<Box>` component can help with styling and integrating third-party components seamlessly into the design system. To achieve this, you can pass the third-party component into the `as` prop (ensure that it forwards the `className`). By defining styles in the css prop, these styles will apply to the third-party component. The `<Box>` component will inherit props from the third-party component in addition to its own props.

```tsx preview file=components/Box/box-as-component.demo.tsx

```

### The CSS Prop

Arbitrary styles can be applied to the underlying element via the css prop. All CSS rules are supported. Values for the rules are extended with the design tokens from the theme. When a design token is used the corresponding value will be applied.

```tsx preview file=components/Box/box-css-prop.demo.tsx

```
