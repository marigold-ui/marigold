The `<Box>` component serves as the foundation of Marigold, acting as the bridge that connects the logic of components with their visual design. Through the use of `<Box>`, theme-based values can be bound to components and utilized for styling. Every component in Marigold is composed of `<Box>` components.

Ideally, you should not need this component frequently, unless you are building a design system component or a custom component that is specific to your app and you want to use the design tokens.

## Usage

### Import

To import the component you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { Box } from '@marigold/components';
```

### Props

<PropsTable
  props={[
    {
      property: 'as',
      type: 'HTMLElement | MarigoldComponent',
      description:
        'Behaves like a HTMLElement or a Marigold component if used.',
      default: 'div',
    },
    {
      property: 'css',
      type: 'CSSObject | CSSObject',
      description: 'Set CSS for the component.',
      default: '',
    },
    {
      property: '...',
      type: '',
      description: 'HTML attributes based on the rendered element.',
      default: '',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Examples

### Polymorphic Component

When using the `<Box>` component, it will render a div element by default. However, you have the option to customize this by using the `as` prop. All regular HTML props will be forwarded to the underlying element. Typescript will ensure that only correct HTML attributes are used by limiting the props based on the `as` prop. This polymorphic type inference will work not only with HTML elements, but also with any React component.

```tsx preview file=components/Box/box-success.demo.tsx

```

### Box as Button

The `as` prop is set to a button HTMLElement on the left side and to a Marigold button on the right.

```tsx preview file=components/Box/button-box.demo.tsx

```

### Box with several props

How to use different props and CSS on the `<Box>`.
