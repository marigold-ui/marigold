caption: Structure for contents in a content context.
---

The `<Body>` is a content component, like the [`<Header>`](/components/header) and [`<Footer>`](/components/footer/) and is used to help structure the contents of components such as a [`<Card>`](/components/card) or [`<Dialog>`](/components/dialog).

It behaves similar to its related components [`<Header>`](/components/header) and [`<Footer>`](/components/footer/). So the component has no properties, but that is not its task. It should wrap other components and structure its contents for a better code base.

You can set `variant` and `size` props to style your `<Body>` element.
