The Button component renders a `<button>` element.
Buttons allow users to perform an action.
They have multiple styles for various needs, and are ideal for calling attention to where a user needs to do something in order to move forward in a flow.
The style variant and size of the button can be added with the variant prop and is composed like `variant.size`.

### Button Sizes

If there are many actions in one page, is it possible to use small buttons instead of big ones. As well if the page is required to be open on mobile devices.
