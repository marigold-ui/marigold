caption: Component to render images
---

The `<Image>` is a content component that renders an image on the page.

The `src` property is always required. It can be used with a link or with an image from the server's file system.

To improve accessibility, `alt` information should be provided whenever possible.
The `alt` attribute holds a text description of the image and screen readers read this description out to their users so they know what the image means. The `alt` text is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for some reason: for example, network errors, content blocking, or linkrot.

      type: 'string',
      description:
        'The alt tag contains descriptive text that is displayed when an image fails to load or is read aloud when a user interacts with a screen reader on the page.',
      default: '',

    {
      property: 'fit',
      type: '"contain" | "cover" | "fill" | "none" | "scale-down"',
      description: 'Resized the Image to fit its container',
      default: '',
    },
    {
      property: 'position',
      type: '"bottom" | "center" | "left" | "right" | "top"',
      description: 'Position the Image inside the container when you use "fit"',
      default: '',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Usage

### Simple Image

In this example you can see a `<Image>` Component.

```tsx preview file=components/Image/image.demo.tsx

```

### Image with fit and position

In this example, the `<Image>` gets the `<fit>` property and the `<position>` property is set to bottom. You also need to wrap the `<Image>` in a `<Ratio>` component so that the fit and position properties can be used.

```tsx preview file=components/Image/image-fit-position.demo.tsx

```
