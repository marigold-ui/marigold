import { App } from '~/demos/theming-extend.demo.tsx';

Themes are used to define the visual appearance of the application and adhere the coporate identity.

In Marigold a theme is a plain object that defines [design tokens](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/) for the context in which it should be used (e.g. B2B or B2C), including a color palette, the typography, scales for white space and size related values. A theme also comes with styles for the app's components.

Marigold's themes are based on the [Theme UI's Theme Specification](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec/) with the addition of styles for all components (`theme.components.<component name>`).

## Use an existing theme

The following themes are currently available:

- **B2B**: The default theme for B2B software.
- **Core**: The theme for applications that life inside the Reservix CORE application.

To install a theme you can use the following command:

```bash onlyCode
    yarn add @marigold/theme-<lowercease theme name>
```

Afterwards pass the `theme` to the `<MarigoldProvider>`:

```jsx onlyCode
import React from 'react';
import { MarigoldProvider } from '@marigold/components';
import theme from '@marigold/theme-b2b';

const App = () => (
  <MarigoldProvider theme={theme}>{/* App code goes here */}</MarigoldProvider>
);
```

Most themes are also using custom fonts. How you do make them available for your users depends on your setup ([CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/), [`next.js`](https://nextjs.org/), ...).

The URL to load the fonts can be imported via the respective theme package. The following examples shows how to load fonts in a `next.js` app. This also supports the [font optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) feature of `next.js`:

```jsx onlyCode
// pages/_document.js
import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';
import { webFontUrl } from '@marigold/theme-b2b';

class MyDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head>
          {webFontUrl.map(url => (
            <link key={url} rel="stylesheet" href={url} />
          ))}
        </Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}

export default MyDocument;
```

In other setup you might need to use [`react-helmet`](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) or can paste the fonts directly into the `<head>` of your HTML.

## Extend an existing theme

Usually using one of the existing themes should be sufficient to build and style an application. But every now and then your app might need a variant that is not included in the theme or it is necessary to adjust existing variants and styles a bit. This is especially useful when designers want to [A/B test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) designs and user flows or if a certain domain logic requires a more individual solution.

Let's image you need a very flashy call to action button for your app, but the default theme for B2B applications does not have such a button. In order to customize the theme and add a CTA button you can extend the theme with customized styles using the `extendsTheme` helper like shown below:

```tsx
import { extendTheme } from '@marigold/components';
import theme from '@marigold/theme-b2b';

const customTheme = extendTheme(theme, {
  fonts: {
    system: 'system-ui, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif',
  },
  components: {
    Button: {
      variant: {
        cta: {
          // You can still use all the tokens from the theme extended theme
          color: 'gray00',
          fontSize: 'xsmall',
          borderRadius: 'large',
          // You can also use tokens defined in the theme extension
          fontFamily: 'system',
          // And if you really want to, even use hard coded values
          background:
            'linear-gradient(319deg, #663dff 0%, #aa00ff 37%, #cc4499 100%)',
          textTransform: 'uppercase',
          fontWeight: 600,
          transition: 'transform 0.25s cubic-bezier(.5, -.1, .1, 1.5)',

          '&:hover': {
            transform: 'scale(1.5)',
          },

          '&:active': {
            transform: 'scale(1.6)',
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});

export const App = () => (
  <MarigoldProvider theme={customTheme}>
    {/** your app code */}
  </MarigoldProvider>
);
```

Afterwards you can use the added variant like you would do with any other variant from the theme. `<Button variant="cta">Buy now</Button>` will render our custom CTA button:

<Preview>
  <App />
</Preview>

Of course you can do this not only with the `Button`, but with any of Marigold's components. Styles for every component can be found under `theme.components.<component name>` and follows the following structure:

###### Extend Styles for a Component

```ts
import type { Theme } from '@marigold/components';

const theme: Theme = {
  components: {
    // Component name
    Button: {
      base: {
        /**
         * Styles that are always applied
         */
      },
      variant: {
        'variant-name': {
          /**
           * Styles that are applied when the `variant`
           * prop is set to the key
           */
        },
      },
      size: {
        'size-name': {
          /**
           * Styles that are applied when the `size`
           * prop is set to the key
           */
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

###### Extend Styles for a Component with Parts

Styles of more complex components, like the `<Dialog>`, have their styles split into parts.

```ts
import type { Theme } from '@marigold/components';

const theme: Theme = {
  components: {
    // Component name
    Dialog: {
      base: {
        container: {
          /**
           * Styles that are always applied to the dialog container
           */
        },
        closeButton: {
          /**
           * Styles that are always applied to the close button
           */
        },
      },
      variant: {
        'variant-name': {
          container: {
            /**
             * Styles that are applied to the container when
             * the `variant` prop is set to the key
             */
          },
          closeButton: {
            /**
             * Styles that are applied to the close button when
             * the `variant` prop is set to the key
             */
          },
        },
      },
      size: {
        'size-name': {
          container: {
            /**
             * Styles that are applied to the container when
             * the `size` prop is set to the key
             */
          },
          closeButton: {
            /**
             * Styles that are applied to the close button when
             * the `size` prop is set to the key
             */
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

We recommend to use TypeScript for the styles so that you don't accidentially have a typo in a name or variant:

```ts
import type { Theme } from '@marigold/components';

export const Dialog: Theme['components']['Dialog'] = {
  // styles
};
```
