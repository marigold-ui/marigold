The `useResponsiveValue` is a client side hook. It can be used to return values based on the current screen size, using breakpoints from the theme `theme.breakpoints`.
You can set as many `breakpoints` as you want.
To add `breakpoints` to your theme you have to write them as an array.

You can pass the following parameters to your `useResponsiveValue` hook:

- **First:** the values as array which defines the `breakpoints`
- **Second:** the `defaultIndex` which points on the default `breakpoint`

```tsx
const value = useResponsiveValue(
  [
    'no breakpoint',
    'larger than 40em',
    'larger than 50em',
    'larger than 60em',
    'larger than 70em',
  ],
  2
);
```

## Usage

### Import

To import the hook you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { useResponsiveValue } from '@marigold/system';
```

## Examples

### useResponsiveValue with breakpoints

Here you can see an example where the `useResponisveValue` hook is used. If you change the size of the screen you will see how the colors and text changes.

The `background-color` from the `<Box>` has some values for each breakpoint one. So if the next `breakpoint` is reached, it will change the value for the background.

```tsx preview file=hooks/useResponsiveValue.demo.tsx

```
