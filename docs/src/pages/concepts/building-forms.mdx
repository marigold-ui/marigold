## Marigold Form Components

Form components are individual elements that make up a form, such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, select fields, text areas and buttons. They allow user input, selection and actions.

Marigold has a few form components that you can use to build your form.

- [Button](/components/button)
- [Checkbox](/components/checkbox)
- [NumberField](/components/number-field)
- [Radio](/components/radio)
- [Select](/components/select)
- [Slider](/components/slider)
- [Switch](/components/switch)
- [TextArea](/components/text-area)
- [TextField](/components/text-field)

## How to layout a formular?

A form layout should be structured in a logical and easy-to-understand manner.
This typically includes grouping related fields together, using clear and concise labels for each field, and providing clear instructions for filling out the form. Additionally, it is important to consider the overall layout of the form, including the use of white space and the placement of buttons and other elements.
Accessibility best practices should be followed, such as providing clear, descriptive labels and ensuring that form fields are appropriately labeled and structured for screen readers.

Here you can see how to layout a classic form with Marigold's `<TextField>` and `<Select>` could be defined.

```tsx preview file=concepts/layout-forms.demo.tsx

```

## Controlled or uncontrolled Components?

In React, there are two main types of form components: controlled and uncontrolled.
Controlled components are components which are controlled by the React state. Any changes to the value will be updated via the state variable. This happens when the user interacts with a component and the `onChange` event handler is called.
Uncontrolled components don't need the state to update, because you can give them a `defaultValue` or `defaultChecked` property.

When the state or props change, React will automatically re-render the component with its new data. This is called [data-binding](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/data-binding/). Components recive data from its parents component and update their output in response to changes in that data by using state and props, this allows to have a dynamic and reactive user interface.

## Interactive Forms

Interactve forms can have several features like error validation, real-time feedback (password-stregth indicator), logic (hide fields if a several field is checked etc.) or autocomplete.
All these features help to make interactive fields more user friendly and more efficient.

### Error Handling

Marigold's form components comes with error props. You can use them to show instead of a helptext an error message. For that the only thing to do is add the prop and make a check.

In this example below you can have an example on how to check if the E-Mail adress is correctly filled.
Try out and type something!

```tsx preview file=concepts/error-handling.demo.tsx

```

### Logical Interaction

You can have interactive forms which contains logical aspects. In this example you can interact with the `<Select>` and a new component `<Checkbox>` will appear. You can try out and switch the value of the select field.

```tsx preview file=concepts/logical-interaction.demo.tsx

```

### Submitting a form

In this example you can see how a form with all its fields can be submitted. The submitted data will be displayed in a alert.

For validate the errors we have used [`Zod`](https://zod.dev/). It is a simple tool for building schemas, which can be validated.

```tsx preview file=concepts/building-forms-zod.demo.tsx

```

## Full example of a form submitting data with React Hook Form

We decided to use react-form-hook because its reducing re-renders caused by state updates, you don't have much to configurate and supports integrating UI libraries.
For the later we use the `<Controller>` component from react-hook-form, which must be wrapped around each Marigold component that should submit data.

### Example of a form

We tried to find a simple but common use case for testing this library and decided that a formular where the data would be submitted is a good case.

```tsx preview file=concepts/building-forms-hook-form.demo.tsx

```

In the formular we have used `<TextField>` components and a `<Select>` component.

### How to do validation and error signaling

Some fields are required and throw error messages if you don't fill them out.
For this to work, react-hook-form has a property `formState`, which contains the boolean `isValid`. This prop is set to `true` if the form doesn't have errors. `isValid` will always observe the entire form to validate.

We don't explicit need to use a `onChange` event, we set a `defaultValue` for each field we want to submit in the `useForm` hook. With that the component is a uncontrolled component, it never gets undefined or null. Instead of using useState and set a value we used directly defaultValue.

There are `rules` that can be applied on the components to trigger the validation, e.g. `required: true`. Our Marigold form components already have error properties and error messages build in. Now it should be combined.
