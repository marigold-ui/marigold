In this example we build a simple form with [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started#IntegratingwithUIlibraries).

## Why react-hook-form?

We decided to use react-form-hook because its reducing rendering, has Typescript support and supports UI libraries
For the later we use the `<Controller>` component from react-hook-form, which must be wrapped around each Marigold component that should submit data.

## Example of building forms

We tried to find a simple but common use case for testing this library and decided that a formular where the data would be submitted is a good case.

In the formular we have used `<TextField>` components and a `<Select>` component.

```tsx preview file=building-forms.demo.tsx

```

### How to do validation and error signaling

Some fields are required and throw error messages if you don't fill them out.
For this to work, react-hook-form has a property `formState`, which contains the boolean `isValid`. This prop is set to `true` if the form doesn't have errors. `isValid` will always observe the entire form to validate.

We don't explicit need to use a `onChange` event, we set a `defaultValue` for each field we want to submit in the `useForm` hook. With that the component is a uncontrolled component, it never gets undefined or null. Instead of using useState and set a value we used directly defaultValue.

There are `rules` that can be applied on the components to trigger the validation, e.g. `required: true`. Our Marigold form components already have error properties and error messages build in. Now it should be combined.
