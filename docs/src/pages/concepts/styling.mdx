Marigold strictly separates the logic of components from their appearance. By default, every component comes with only basic styling that mostly serves to normalize the appearance between browsers. The main concern of a component is to manage its logic and accessibility features associated with its use case.

To give components a certain appearance, we use what are called "themes." Themes are the other half of the equation, as they contain all design tokens and define which styles are applied to a certain component.

This separation enables styling of components to extend beyond just changing design tokens. With Marigold themes, full control over the CSS of each component is allowed, enabling them to be perfectly adjusted and fitted to a corporate identity.
