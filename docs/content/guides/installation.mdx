# Getting Started

## Installation

Marigold is open source and available as in npm. To install the components, run the following in your interpreter:

```bash code
# with npm
npm install @marigold/components --save

# with yarn
yarn add @marigold/components
```

Add the package `@marigold/icons` if you want to use icons in Marigold.

## Usage

Marigold components don't use a theme by default. Add a theme to your application with the `ThemeProvider`
component and by providing a theme in context. You can use one of the Marigold themes:

```bash code
# with npm
npm install @marigold/theme-unicorn --save

# with yarn
yarn add @marigold/theme-unicorn
```

Wrap your application and all components with the `ThemeProvider` component.

```tsx code
import React from 'react'
import { ThemeProvider } from '@marigold/system'
import unicornTheme from '@marigold/theme-unicorn'

const App = () => {
    return (
        <ThemeProvider theme={unicornTheme}>
            <Button variant="primary.small">Hello World</Button>
        </ThemeProvider>
    );
}
```
