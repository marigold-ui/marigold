# Getting Started

## Installation

Marigold is open source and available on npm. To install the components, run the following in your terminal:

```bash code
# with npm
npm install @marigold/components --save

# with yarn
yarn add @marigold/components
```

Add the package `@marigold/icons` if you want to use icons in Marigold.

## Usage

Marigold components don't come with a theme by default. In order to add a theme to your application, use the `ThemeProvider`
component and thereby provide a theme in context. You can use one of the following themes: <Link to="themes/b2b">B2B Theme</Link> or <Link to="themes/unicorn">Unicorn Theme</Link>.

```bash code
# with npm
npm install @marigold/theme-unicorn --save

# with yarn
yarn add @marigold/theme-unicorn
```

Wrap your application and all components with the `ThemeProvider` component.

```tsx code
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@marigold/system';
import unicornTheme from '@marigold/theme-unicorn';

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={unicornTheme}>
      <Button variant="primary.small">Hello World</Button>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```
