# CSS in Javascript

## What's CSS in JS?

CSS in JS follows the principle that you pack your CSS styles directly into your components instead of Stylesheets.
Marigold uses the CSS-in-JS-Library called [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).
CSS-in-JS is in fact a JavaScript library that bundles each JavaScript component with all its belonging CSS rules and dependencies.

Most libraries are designed to:

- Let you author CSS in JavaScript syntax
- Colocate styles with components
- Take advantage of native JS syntax features
- Take advantage of anything from the JS ecosystem

## Why CSS in JS?

### Scoped CSS

All CSS in JS libs are creating automatically unique names for css classes. The styles are only applied to the respective component.
Styling outside the component remains completely unaffected by them.
This prevents the collision of css classnames and reduces the struggle in finding a suitable classname.

### No inline styles

With css in js, no styles are assigned within the HTML. We are using **no style props** like `<div style={{ padding: '8px' }}>`
This gives us the following advantages: Responsive designs which are not possible using inline styles can be used with css in js.
Furthermore, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements and media queries can be used.
In addition, inline styles are generally considered to be less performant than classnames.

### Server-Side-Rendering

The Marigold Design-System is generated with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and supports SSR.
During SSR, only the styles necessary to render the initial view are added to the HTML document. Dynamic styles are removed to reduce the amount of code.
This has a positive effect on performance, because there is no separate CSS file that has to be retrieved from the server to block the rendering process.

### The className property

Theme styles are applied with a classname. Emotion outputs the classnames as a string that can then be assigned to HTML elements like this:
`<button class='css-ase7ea css-1nt0tt7'>`.
The principle is to define styles first and then apply it to the component which should be styled.

## Whats CSS in JS not?

CSS-in-JS does not get rid of the need to understand the following:

- How styles are applied to the DOM
- How inheritance works
- How CSS properties work
- How CSS layout works
