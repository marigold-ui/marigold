## cn function

To combine Tailwind CSS classes with other classes, utilize the `cn` function within the className attribute to merge them seamlessly. The inputs of the `className` accept nearly every type. You can pass in arrays, boolean conditions, strings or numbers.

### Import

To import the function you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { cn } from '@marigold/system';
```

### Examples

In this example you can see how to use the `cn` function on a `<div>` element. Here are written down some Tailwind CSS class names which will be merged with the ones before. So in the end the class names will be rendered (if `myValue` will be true) as `className='flex flex-col cursor-pointer p-4'`

```tsx
const myOtherValue = 'p-4'
...
<div
  className={cn(
    'flex flex-col p-3',
    myValue ? 'cursor-pointer' : 'cursor-not-allowed',
    myOtherValue
  )}
/>
```

In this code you can see that `p-3` will be overwritten by `p-4`, so keep in mind the order of your class names.
