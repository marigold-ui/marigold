Elevations serve as the foundational layers of the UI, providing a clean slate upon which various UI elements can be placed. It is important for creating visual hierarchy, depth, and clarity within a user interface. It guides user attention, improves usability, and enhances the overall user experience by providing feedback, organizing elements, and maintaining consistency in branding.

We create different surface levels, for each layer that a component can be placed.
The elevation consists of background colors and shadows. Meaning a background surface should be used together with a shadow surface token.

## Types of Elevation

We support four levels of elevation.

/>

Starting by the lowest elevation level, the types will be explained in the following.

### Sunken

The deepest surface level we support is sunken. Sunken surfaces should only be used to the default surface level. Avoid applying sunken elevations to raised or overlay elevations.

The token you need is `bg-surface-sunken` and this should only be used together with `shadow-surface-sunken` which has a value of `none` because on sunken surfaces shoulnd't be a shadow.

<ComponentDemo file="./surface-sunken.demo.tsx" />

### DEFAULT

The default surface is the ground-surface level. It should be set as root surface background on the `<body>` element. It has no visual lift and should be the starting point of each page.

The used token is `bg-surface` together with `shadow-surface` which will also be `none`.

(example)

### Raised

Raised is one level higher than the default surface. It will be used for example on `<Card>`s. The intent of raised surface elevation is to make certain elements stand out more in the design, showing that they're more important or prominent.

The token used is `bg-surface-raised` and should be used together with `shadow-surface-raised`. The shadow creates a higher hierarchy from the ground level.

(example)

### Overlay

Overlay is the highest elevation used for elements that appear above others, like modals, dialogs, menus or popovers in general. Overlays can stack on top of other overlays.

The used token is `bg-surface-overlay` and should be used together with `shadow-surface-overlay` wihch creates a shadow to disaplay a higher hierarchy.
