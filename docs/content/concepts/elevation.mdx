Elevations serve as the foundational layers of the UI, providing a clean slate upon which various UI elements can be placed. It is important for creating visual hierarchy, depth, and clarity within a user interface. It guides user attention, improves usability, and enhances the overall user experience by providing feedback, organizing elements, and maintaining consistency in branding.

We create different surface levels, for each layer that a component can be placed.
The elevation consists of background colors and shadows. Meaning a background surface should be used together with a shadow surface token to create more depth.

## Types of Elevation

We support four levels of elevation.

  className="mx-auto block"
/>

These elevation levels are important for creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces, as they help users understand the organization and hierarchy of content within an application or website. By using different elevation levels appropriately, designers can improve usability and enhance the overall user experience.
Starting by the lowest elevation level, the types will be explained in the following.

### Sunken

The deepest surface level we support is sunken. Sunken surfaces should only be used to the default surface level. Avoid applying sunken elevations to raised or overlay elevations.

The token you need is `bg-surface-sunken` and this should only be used together with `shadow-surface-sunken` which has a value of `none` because on sunken surfaces shoulnd't be a shadow.

<ComponentDemo file="./surface-sunken.demo.tsx" />

### DEFAULT

The default surface acts as the ground-surface level. It has no visual lift and should be the starting point of each page. This can be for example the `<body>`.

The used token is `bg-surface` together with `shadow-surface` which will also be `none`.

<ComponentDemo file="./surface-default.demo.tsx" />

### Raised

Raised is one level higher than the default surface. It will be used for example on `<Card>`s. The intent of raised surface elevation is to make certain elements stand out more in the design, showing that they're more important or prominent.

The token used is `bg-surface-raised` and should be used together with `shadow-surface-raised`. The shadow creates a higher hierarchy from the ground level.

<ComponentDemo file="./surface-raised.demo.tsx" />

### Overlay

Overlay is the highest elevation used for elements that appear above others, like modals, dialogs, menus or popovers in general. Overlays can stack on top of other overlays.

The used token is `bg-surface-overlay` and should be used together with `shadow-surface-overlay` wihch creates a shadow to display a higher hierarchy.

<ComponentDemo file="./surface-overlay.demo.tsx" />

## Usage all together

In a common layout the surface default is always the ground base for other elements. You should take use of it and avoid excessive use of raised and overlay elevations. Make sure to use the shadow tokens correctly with the background tokens.

In this example all elevation levels are shown in a full page example layout. The surface default behaves as the ground-surface, with the sunken and raised surfaces for creating a visual hierarchy. Overlay surface will be on elements like `Popover`.
