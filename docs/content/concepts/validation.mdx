HTML forms enable the collection and submission of user input on web pages. Form elements also support validation of those inputs through attributes like "required" and input types such as "email" or "number" to provide users with feedback.

Marigold's components seamlessly integrate with HTML forms, providing a developer-friendly solution for effective input data validation. It supports native attributes such as "required" and validation based on input types. Furthermore, Marigold's form elements enable the incorporation of custom validation functions, enhancing the browser's validation capabilities.
