HTML forms enable the collection and submission of user input on web pages. Form elements also support validation of those inputs through attributes like "required" and input types such as "email" or "number" to provide users with feedback.

Marigold's components seamlessly integrate with HTML forms, providing a developer-friendly solution for effective input data validation. It supports native attributes such as "required" and validation based on input types. Furthermore, Marigold's form elements enable the incorporation of custom validation functions, enhancing the browser's validation capabilities.

## Field Anatomy

An accessible form input includes a clear label associated with its corresponding form control (`<input>`, `<select>`, ...). Additional guidance is provided by a help text, which can give additional context or instructions or display a descriptive messages.

<Image
  src="/field.png"
  alt="Anatomy of a field"
  width={300}
  height={150}
  className="mx-auto block"
/>

Marigold's form components allow to set these properties like shown below. All form components allow to set a `label`, `description` and `errorMessages` besides some additional control-specific props.

```tsx
<TextField
  label="Promo Code"
  description="You can find the code on the back of your ticket."
  errorMessage="The promo code was already used."
/>
```
