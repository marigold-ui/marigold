// TODO: add short introduction

## Breaking Change

### Unify label API

- the `<Checkbox>` and `<Switch>` components used the `children` prop for their labels, to make it clearer what and unify the API with other form controls, they also now have a `label` prop. The `children` are no longer supported

**Before v12:**

```tsx
<Checkbox>Do you agree?</Checkbox>
<Switch>Dark mode</Switch>
```

**With v12:**

```tsx
<Checkbox label="Do you agree?" />
<Switch label="Dark mode" />
```

### ListBox

- the listbox is used by multiple components (`<Select>`, `<ComboBox>`, ...). basically everytime you pick something from a list of options
- the components is currently only used internally
- breaking change does not change the component APIs, but how the were styled
- before components that used the `<ListBox>` styled the items via `option`, it is now called `item`. this was done to unify

## Improvements

### RUI Theme

- continue to improve the theme, still in beta, but we are now have a few applications that already use the theme in production, stable enought to already use
- RUI is now available in the docs via the theme switcher on the top right
- RUI is also available in storybook
- can find more detailed and component-specific information in the components section
- what is a good reason to leave the "beta"?

- checkout latest [Storybook](https://marigold-latest.vercel.app/?path=%2Fstory%2Fcomponents-accordion--basic&globals=theme%3Arui).

### RUI style utils

- we started creating TailwindCSS utils within RUI to make it easier for everybody to apply the styles to custom components

- `util-focus-ring` to apply focus styles, this should be usually be used with the `focus-visible:` modfifier. also don't forget to add `outline-none` to make sure no default outlines are shown
- `utils-focus-borderless-ring` when component have their own border that you don't want to touch
- `util-disabled` Defines a consistent visual and behavioral style for disabled UI elements.
- `util-surface-{sunken, body, raised, overlay}`: These utility classes define visual surfaces with distinct background colors and elevation levels. Elevation is conveyed through shadows and borders, helping establish depth, hierarchy, and separation between interface layers. Use them to apply consistent surface styling across components.

- not yet documented but you can view them here: https://github.com/marigold-ui/marigold/blob/main/themes/theme-rui/src/utils.css
