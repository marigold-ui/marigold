While many are taking a summer break, Marigold never rests! v15.0.0 arrives with hot new features and improvements to keep your projects blooming all season long. Check out what‚Äôs fresh below! üçâ

## Breaking Changes

The `<Header>`, `<Body>`, and `<Footer>` components have been removed. These were originally intended as reusable building blocks for components like `<Dialog>` and `<Card>`, but we found that dedicated compound components (such as `<Dialog.Content>`) offer a better developer experience. Subcomponents are more discoverable and easier to style based on their specific usage.

The `<Image>` component has been removed. It didn‚Äôt provide significant benefits beyond offering shortcuts for Tailwind classes, which can easily be applied directly to native `<img>` elements as needed.

| Prop type    | Prop value    | Tailwind class        |
| ------------ | ------------- | --------------------- |
| **fit**      | `contain`     | `object-contain`      |
|              | `cover`       | `object-cover`        |
|              | `fill`        | `object-fill`         |
|              | `none`        | `unset`               |
|              | `scaleDown`   | `object-scale-down`   |
| **position** | `none`        | ‚Äî (no class)          |
|              | `bottom`      | `object-bottom`       |
|              | `center`      | `object-center`       |
|              | `left`        | `object-left`         |
|              | `leftBottom`  | `object-left-bottom`  |
|              | `leftTop`     | `object-left-top`     |
|              | `right`       | `object-right`        |
|              | `rightBottom` | `object-right-bottom` |
|              | `rightTop`    | `object-right-top`    |
|              | `top`         | `object-top`          |
