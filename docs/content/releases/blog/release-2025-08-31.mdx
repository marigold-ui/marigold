The latest Marigold release introduces refined APIs, improved documentation, and a key styling update—aimed at boosting consistency, usability, and developer experience.

## Breaking Changes

- removed header, body, footer components. this components were planned to be used as reusable parts in a components like `<Dialog>` and `<Card>`. but we had better dev experience with creating dedicated compound component, like `<Dialog.Content>` etc. this makes available sub components more discoverable and easier to style different base on their usage.
- removed image, didn't do a lot can do the same using tailwind directly
