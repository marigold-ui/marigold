Hi Marigold users! Following our recent heads-up about Marigold Version 10.0, we're excited to share the details of this major release. With this update, we're introducing significant breaking changes alongside new features and improvements.

Previously, we informed you that this release is crucial for enhancing flexibility and accessibility within Marigold. Now, let’s dive deeper into what you can expect.

## Breaking Change

### Dialog component

We've restructured the `<Dialog>` component for greater customization and usability:

- Renamed: `<Dialog.Headline>` is now `<Dialog.Title>`.
- New Subcomponents: Introduced `<Dialog.Content>`, `<Dialog.Actions>`, and `<Dialog.Footer>` for better organization and flexibility.
- Grid Layout: The internal dialog layout now uses grid areas to ensure consistent ordering and alignment.

**Why we did this:** These updates allow the dialog to be more customizable and compatible with existing styles from the core system. It simplifies the component structure, making it easier for users to implement.

<SectionMessage>
  <SectionMessage.Title>
  What you have to do:
  </SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
  Update existing `<Dialog>` component implementations to adopt the new structure.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

### Select component

- Refactored the Section (from Listbox) to fit our API, no need for the extra Header anymore. Instead you can do `<Select.Section header="My header">`, same for the other components

**Why we did this:** We’ve streamlined the usage of the `Section` component, removing the need for a generic reusable `<Header>` and simplifying it into a prop for better clarity and ease of use.

<SectionMessage>
  <SectionMessage.Title>What you have to do:</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    Update your headers in the select component.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

### Item component

- Renamed `Item` to `Option` in `<ComboBox>` and `<Autocomplete>` to align with `<Select.Option>`

**Why we did this:** We wanted to align the spelling from the items. Now all selectable options are called options.

<SectionMessage>
  <SectionMessage.Title>
  What you have to do:
  </SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
 Update all `<Autocomplete.Item>` and `<ComboBox.Item>` to `<Autocomplete.Option>` and `<ComboBox.Option>`
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

## New

### Components

- **Dialog**: Now supports a new size prop for more flexible sizing.
- **Autocomplete and Combobox**: These components now support sections.
- **SectionMessage**: added a close button to allow the user to dismiss the `<SectionMessage>` this is now aligned with our feedback message pattern.
- **XLoader**: added prop `mode` to support inline and full-section loading.

### Types

- **Selection**: We now expose `Selection` type for easy usage with `<Table>` and other components.

### Accessibility

- **ARIA Role for Layout Components:** Layout components can now be marked as regions, improving accessibility by helping assistive technologies identify key sections of the page.
- **Accessible ARIA Labelling:** `<Text>` and `<Headline>` components now support ARIA labeling props (aria-label, id, etc.) without causing type errors.
- **Accessibility page:** Added a [dedicated page](/foundations/accessibility) about Accessibility in our documentation.

### Docs improvements

We’ve introduced several updates to enhance the usability and structure of our documentation:

- **New Landing Page:** As you may already saw, we provided a new landing page for our documentation. With this user-friendly landing page, we can effectively helps visitors orient themselves, understand the purpose of the design system, and the user can easily navigate to relevant sections.
- **Streamlined Structure:** We also cleaned up the documentation structure, we reduced old content, structured the navigation and tidy up related pages according the new structure.
- **Component Pages:** Of course we also provided more updated guidelines for component pages, like `<SectionMessag>` or `<MarigoldProvider>`.
- **Release Blog:** And we now have these new release blog, you are currently reading, to keep users informed about recent changes, new features, and important announcements, ensuring they are always up-to-date with the latest information.

## Changes

- **Checkbox Group:** The `<Checkbox.Group>` can now be used as a compound component, aligning it with the structure of other components.

## Bug fixes

- **Focus Fixes:** We’ve addressed an issue where the focus ring wasn’t displaying correctly for `<Checkbox>`, ensuring that it now shows up properly when used in a table context.
- **Menu Accessibility:** Fixed the issue of passing the aria-label to the menu button, instead its now passed to the menu itself.
