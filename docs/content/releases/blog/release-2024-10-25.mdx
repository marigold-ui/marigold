This release introduces several major and minor changes, along with patches that improve accessibility, component flexibility, and consistency across the Marigold. Here’s a breakdown:

## Breaking Change

### Dialog component

- `<Dialog.Headline>` is renamed to `<Dialog.Title>`
- New subcomponents: `<Dialog.Content>`, `<Dialog.Actions>`, and `<Dialog.Footer>` offer better organization and flexibility.
- The dialog layout now uses a grid system for consistent ordering and structure.

**Why we did this:**
With this we improved the dialog to be more customazible. It can implement existing styles from the core and has an easier usage for our users.

<SectionMessage>
  <SectionMessage.Title>
  What you have to do:
  </SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
  Update existing `<Dialog>` component implementations to adopt the new structure.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

### Select component

- Refactored the Section (from Listbox) to fit our API, no need for the extra Header anymore. Instead you can do `<Select.Section header="My header">`, same for the other components

**Why we did this:** We wanted to get away from the "general reusable" components, like `<Header>` and adjust it as prop for the sections.

### Item component

- Renamed `Item` to `Option` in `<Combobox>` and `<Autocomplete>` to align with `<Select.Option>`

**Why we did this:** We wanted to align the spelling from the items. Now all selectable options are called options.

## New

We’ve reimagined our theming system from the ground up. You can now:

Toggle dark mode in a single click.
Define custom color schemes with easy CSS variable support.
Build dynamic themes based on user preferences—no complex CSS required.

With performance optimizations in v2.0, your app’s UI will load faster and feel more responsive:

Smaller bundle sizes: We’ve trimmed down the library for better performance.
Lazy loading: Load components on demand to keep things snappy.
Optimized rendering: Minimized reflows and repaints for improved performance.
♿ 4. Accessibility That Works Out of the Box
We believe in making the web accessible to all. With improved ARIA support, better keyboard navigation, and enhanced screen reader compatibility, v2.0 ensures your app is usable by everyone.

## Changes

Our documentation has been revamped for clarity and ease of use:

Interactive code examples and live playgrounds for real-time testing.
Step-by-step guides for React, Vue, and vanilla JS integrations.
A streamlined customization guide to make theming and extending components simple.
