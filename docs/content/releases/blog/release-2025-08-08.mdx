The latest Marigold release brings a range of enhancements across components, documentation, and infrastructureâ€”focused on improved accessibility, flexibility, and design consistency.

## Breaking Changes

**Deprecation of className property on `<Button>` component**: The `className` property is no longer supported on the `<Button>` component. This change ensures a more consistent and predictable API. Instead of using `className` for custom styling, you should utilize the built-in styling properties such as `size` and `variant` to achieve your desired appearance. This approach maintains design system consistency while providing the flexibility you need for different button styles.

## Improvements

### Components

#### New Features:

**New `<SelectList.Action>` API**: We've enhanced the SelectList component with a new `<SelectList.Action>` API to provide better control over action positioning within SelectList items. This new API automatically handles the positioning of interactive elements like buttons or links at the end of each list item, ensuring consistent layout and improved user experience.

```tsx
<SelectList selectionMode="multiple" items={items}>
  {item => (
    <SelectList.Item textValue={item.name}>
      <SelectList.Action>
        <Button aria-label="Info" onPress={() => showInfo(item)}>
          <InfoIcon />
        </Button>
      </SelectList.Action>
      {item.name}
    </SelectList.Item>
  )}
</SelectList>
```

The `<SelectList.Action>` automatically positions actions at the end of the item using CSS ordering, making it easier to create consistent interactive lists without manual positioning.
