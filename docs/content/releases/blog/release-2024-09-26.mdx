## Breaking Change

We’re thrilled to introduce Marigold UI v2.0—a major upgrade designed to make building beautiful, accessible interfaces faster and easier than ever. Whether you’re crafting an enterprise-level web app or a sleek personal project, v2.0 offers the tools and flexibility you need to create polished UIs with minimal effort.

## New

We’ve reimagined our theming system from the ground up. You can now:

Toggle dark mode in a single click.
Define custom color schemes with easy CSS variable support.
Build dynamic themes based on user preferences—no complex CSS required.

With performance optimizations in v2.0, your app’s UI will load faster and feel more responsive:

Smaller bundle sizes: We’ve trimmed down the library for better performance.
Lazy loading: Load components on demand to keep things snappy.
Optimized rendering: Minimized reflows and repaints for improved performance.
♿ 4. Accessibility That Works Out of the Box
We believe in making the web accessible to all. With improved ARIA support, better keyboard navigation, and enhanced screen reader compatibility, v2.0 ensures your app is usable by everyone.

## Changes

Our documentation has been revamped for clarity and ease of use:

Interactive code examples and live playgrounds for real-time testing.
Step-by-step guides for React, Vue, and vanilla JS integrations.
A streamlined customization guide to make theming and extending components simple.
