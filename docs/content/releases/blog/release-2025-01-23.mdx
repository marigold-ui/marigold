Happy New Year! ðŸ¥³ Marigold v10.1.2 kicks off the year with updates to key components, bug fixes, and the introduction of a brand-new component. Thanks for being part of the journeyâ€”weâ€™re excited for whatâ€™s ahead.

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s new!

## Improvements

### Components

- **SectionMessage:** You now have the possibility to control the dismissable `<SectionMessage>` we've added the properties `close` and `onCloseChange` to handle the dismissable state.
- **XLoader:** The `<XLoader>` was refactored and is now more accessible! Besides this the docs page were updated.
- **Pagination:** We added a new component `<Pagination>` to the Marigold library. This component is used to divide and navigate large data sets. You can find more information about this component in the documentation.

### Documentation

We of course also keep on updating our component documentation pages. These following pages have been updated:

- `<Aspect>`
