Happy Spring, Marigold users! ðŸŒ¸ We're excited to announce the release of **Marigold Version 11.2.2**! This update brings a new component and several improvements to our new RUI theme, all inspired by your valuable feedback. Letâ€™s dive into the details!

## Improvements

### Components

#### MultiSelect

We've added a new `<MultiSelect>` component. This component allows users to select multiple options from a list, making it easier to manage and filter data. The `<MultiSelect>` component replaces the recipe we had for a multi select dropdown, providing a more user-friendly experience.

To learn more about the `<MultiSelect>` component, check out the [documentation](/components/form/multiselect).

### RUI Theme

Our Marigold theme for RUI is now a beta version. ðŸŽ‰ We applied new styles to the components and improved the overall look and feel of the UI. The theme is now more consistent and visually appealing, making it easier to use and navigate.

To see the updated styles on our components, check out our [Storybook](https://marigold-latest.vercel.app/?path=/story/components-accordion--basic).

We will constantly improve the theme based on your feedback, so please let us know what you think!
