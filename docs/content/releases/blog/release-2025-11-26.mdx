The leaves are falling, the air is crisp, and that familiar end-of-year rush is in full swing. Everyone is head-down, pushing to hit those final goals and wrap up projects before the holidays.

Marigold v16.0.0 is here with smoother interactions, improved APIs, and new features to help you finish the year strong. See what’s new below!

## Breaking Changes

### Accordion

- Smoother animation for expanding/collapsing.
- The classname `content` is renamed to `panel`. `content` now exists one level deeper in the hierarchy for additional styling if needed.

### Label

- Removed the `indicator` styling from `<Label>`. The component is no longer multipart (style directly with `cva()`). Style the required indicator as needed, e.g. `'group-required/field:after:content-["*"]'`.

### Loader (formerly XLoader)

- `<XLoader>` is now `<Loader>`.
- New prop `loaderType` (default: loading circle). Use `loaderType='xloader'` for the classic xloader icon.

## Components

### FileField (alpha)

A new dedicated component for file uploads: `<FileField>`. Check out our [storybook](https://marigold-latest.vercel.app/?path=/story/components-filefield--basic) for a preview. This component is in early alpha—feedback and early adopters are welcome!

## Documentation

- Usage guidelines for button placement and order are now available. See the [documentation](/components/actions/button) for details.
- Updated documentation for Accordion, Loader, and FileField components.
- Button usage guidelines added.

## Bug fixes

- Removed extra spacing caused by hidden/a11y elements in.
- Removed extra spacing in `<Container>`.
- Focus ring for `<CloseButton>` now only appears when focused via keyboard.
- Fixed Listbox layout when a `<ListBox.Item>` contains more than one element (e.g., both a label and a description).
