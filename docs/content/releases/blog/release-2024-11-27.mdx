Happy fall Marigold users! üçÅ The newest version of Marigold Version 10.0.1 arrives. The good news - no breaking changes this time!
We've focused on revising more components and improve components based on your feedback. Let's dive into the details.

## Improvements

### Components

#### Select

The `isOpen` prop was set by default. We removed it because it's only needed when the component is controlled.

#### Slider

The `<Slider>` gained a in deep revision:

- documentation were revised to our new documentation structure
- the stories in Storybook were updated and also new stories were added
- we've decided to add in general a visible indicator for the selected track
- it's now possible to use a "range" slider with two thumbs
- `<Slider>` is also a form component, so the `description` prop (Helptext) can now be used like in other form components

#### Loading spinner

We were not satisfied with our loading spinner in buttons. So far we have used the `<XLoader>`, which in our opinion was not the best solution, as the loading animation is difficult to recognise in the dots of the X and the `<XLoader>` would have to be displayed larger to make the effect really visible (and therefore informative for users). In addition, the format of the `<XLoader>` does not match the format of the button.

We have therefore revised this and decided to use a new loading spinner. It is now a simple spinner that is displayed in the button, which makes the loading status more recognisable, the information about the loading status is better communicated to users and we have improved accessibility.

You can see the new loading spinner in the button in the [Button documentation](../../components/form/button) and in the [Loading States](../../patterns/loading-states).

### Documentation

We've revised a lot of components according to our new structure of component documentation pages:

- `<Badge>`
- `<Card>`
- `<Columns>`
- `<DateField>`
- `<DatePicker>`
- `<Icon>`
- `<Slider>`

### Bundle size

We've optimized the bundle size of Marigold by removing the icons dependency from components package. This will help to improve the performance of your applications.
