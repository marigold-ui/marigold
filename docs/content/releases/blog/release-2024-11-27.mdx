Happy fall Marigold users! üçÅ The newest version of Marigold Version 10.0.1 arrives. The good news - no breaking changes this time!
We've focused on revising more components and improve components based on your feedback. Let's dive into the details.

## Improvements

### Components

#### Select

The `isOpen` prop was set by default. We removed it because it's only needed when the component is controlled.

#### Slider

The `<Slider>` gained a in deep revision:

- documentation were revised to our new documentation structure
- the stories in Storybook were updated and also new stories were added
- we've decided to add in general a visible indicator for the selected track
- it's now possible to use a "range" slider with two thumbs
- `<Slider>` is also a form component, so the `description` prop (Helptext) can now be used like in other form components

### Documentation

We've revised a lot of components according to our new structure of component documentation pages:

- `<Badge>`
- `<Card>`
- `<Columns>`
- `<DateField>`
- `<DatePicker>`
- `<Icon>`
- `<Slider>`

### Bundle size

We've optimized the bundle size of Marigold by removing the icons dependency from components package. This will help to improve the performance of your applications.
