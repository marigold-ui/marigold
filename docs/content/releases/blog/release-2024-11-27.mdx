Happy Fall, Marigold users! 🍁 We're excited to announce the release of **Marigold Version 10.1.0**! This update brings improved documentation and several improvements to our components, all inspired by your valuable feedback. Let’s dive into the details!

## Improvements

### Components

#### Slider

Along with a complete overhaul of the documentation and stories for our `<Slider>`, the component has received several visual and functional improvements.

We've introduced a visible indicator for the selected track to enhance usability. and the `<Slider>` now supports dual thumbs, allowing users to select a range seamlessly. To make the `<Slider>` even more versatile, it now functions as a standard form component, complete with support for a `name` attribute and an optional help text.

#### Button

We weren’t satisfied with the `<XLoader>` as a button loading spinner. Its animation was hard to recognize due to the dot design, and it needed to be larger to be effective—making it inconsistent with button formatting. We’ve replaced it with a new, simple spinner that fits seamlessly into buttons. This update improves visibility, better communicates the loading status, and enhances accessibility.

Check out the new loading spinner in the [Button documentation](/components/actions/button) and [Loading States](/patterns/loading-states).

### Documentation

We’re continuing to enhance our component documentation to provide clearer guidance on their intended usage and best practices. The following pages have been updated:

- `<Aside>`
- `<Badge>`
- `<Card>`
- `<Center>`
- `<Columns>`
- `<DateField>`
- `<DatePicker>`
- `<Icon>`
- `<Scrollable>`
- `<Slider>`

### Misc

- We've optimized the bundle size of Marigold by removing the icons dependency from components package to help to improve the performance of your applications.
- We updated `react-aria` to the latest version.

## Bug fixes

This release also includes several bug fixes to improve stability and ensure a smoother experience. Thank you for reporting issues and helping us make Marigold better!
