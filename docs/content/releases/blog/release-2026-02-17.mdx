New year, new foundations! While the first weeks of 2026 are flying by, we've been heads-down building a stronger base for Marigold. This release brings a brand-new semantic spacing system, a refreshed surface styling, and several new components to help you build better interfaces faster.

Marigold v17.0.0 is here, so let's dive in!

## Breaking Changes

### Surface Styling Refactored

The surface styling system has been completely refactored. This improves contrast and depth across all surface-based components like inputs, cards, and dialogs.

Shadow elevation is now independent of the surface styling itself, making it more reusable. To add a shadow based on the elevation level, use the regular Tailwind `shadow-*` class with the elevation tokens (e.g. `shadow-elevation-raised`, `shadow-elevation-overlay`).

**Migration:**

```css
/* Before */
.util-surface-raised

/* After */
.ui-surface.shadow-elevation-raised
```

Deprecated utilities `util-focus-*` and `util-disabled` have been removed. Use the new state utilities instead: `ui-state-focus`, `ui-state-disabled`, `ui-state-error`, `ui-state-readonly`.

### Semantic Spacing System

A new relational spacing scale has been introduced that describes the strength of relationships between elements:

| Token     | Value   | Use case                                    |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `joined`  | 0.25rem | Elements attached as a single unit          |
| `tight`   | 1rem    | Packed containers for high-density scanning |
| `related` | 2rem    | Minimal separation for related pairs        |
| `peer`    | 4rem    | Self-contained equals in the same flow      |
| `group`   | 8rem    | Logical separation between content zones    |
| `section` | 16rem   | Distinct layout sections                    |
| `context` | 32rem   | Complete contextual shift                   |

**Migration:**

```tsx
// Before
<Stack space="fieldY">
<Inline space="fieldX">

// After
<Stack space="peer">
<Inline space="related">
```

### Card

`<Card>` now uses semantic spacing. The `size="full"` prop has been replaced by the new `stretch` property. Additionally, cards now always take full width by default.

```tsx
// Before
<Card size="full">...</Card>

// After
<Card stretch>...</Card>
```

### ContextualHelp

Size variants have been removed from `<ContextualHelp>`. The component now has a single, improved default style.

### Table

The `<Table>` component has been completely rewritten with a modern API built on react-aria-components. The old implementation has been moved to `@marigold/components/legacy`.

**Key migration points:**

- `emptyState` prop moved from `<Table>` to `<Table.Body>`
- `align` prop renamed to `alignX` on `<Table.Column>`, `<Table.Cell>`, and `<Table.EditableCell>`
- Column widths now use pixel values or CSS grid units (e.g., `"200px"`, `"1fr"`) instead of Tailwind classes
- Inlining form fields in cells is no longer supported — use `<Table.EditableCell>` instead

```tsx
// Before
import { Table } from '@marigold/components';

// After - Option 1: Use legacy export (temporary)
import { Table } from '@marigold/components/legacy';

// After - Option 2: Migrate to new Table API (recommended)
<Table>
  <Table.Header>
    <Table.Column>Name</Table.Column>
    <Table.Column>Email</Table.Column>
  </Table.Header>
  <Table.Body>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>John Doe</Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>john@example.com</Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Body>
</Table>
```

### Multiselect Deprecated

The `<Multiselect>` component has been deprecated in favor of the new `<TagField>` component. See the TagField section below for details.

### SelectList

The `dragAndDropHooks` prop has been removed from `<SelectList>`.

### TabList

The `space` prop has been removed from `<TabList>`.

## Components

### Table

The new `<Table>` component is a full rewrite with modern features including sorting, single/multiple row selection, row actions, editable cells via `<Table.EditableCell>`, drag and drop reordering, sticky headers, and empty state support. It is fully accessible with keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

```tsx
<Table selectionMode="multiple">
  <Table.Header>
    <Table.Column allowsSorting>Name</Table.Column>
    <Table.Column allowsSorting>Email</Table.Column>
  </Table.Header>
  <Table.Body emptyState={<EmptyState>No data</EmptyState>}>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>John Doe</Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>john@example.com</Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Body>
</Table>
```

### TagField (beta)

The new `<TagField>` component replaces `<Multiselect>`. It provides a multi-select field that displays selected items as removable tags with a searchable dropdown. It supports controlled/uncontrolled selection, disabled state, error state, disabled keys, sections, and custom empty states.

### ActionBar (alpha)

A new `<ActionBar>` component for bulk operations on selected items. It appears as a floating toolbar when users select multiple items in tables or lists. It automatically shows the selection count and provides action buttons for common operations like edit, delete, or copy.

```tsx
<ActionBar selectedItemCount={3} onClearSelection={() => clearSelection()}>
  <ActionBar.Button onPress={() => editItems()}>Edit</ActionBar.Button>
  <ActionBar.Button onPress={() => deleteItems()}>Delete</ActionBar.Button>
</ActionBar>
```

### EmptyState (beta)

The new `<EmptyState>` component provides a standardized way to display placeholder content when a view has no data to show. Use it for empty lists, search results with no matches, or initial states.

### ToggleButton & ToggleButtonGroup (alpha)

New `<ToggleButton>` and `<ToggleButtonGroup>` components allow users to toggle between states or select from a group of options. These are ideal for toolbar-style controls, view switches, and filter toggles.

### Calendar

The `<Calendar>` component has been refactored with a new API. Two new props enable multi-month calendar views:

- **`visibleDuration`**: Controls the number of visible months (1-3 months). Default: `{ months: 1 }`.
- **`pageBehavior`**: Controls navigation strategy. `'single'` pages by one month, `'visible'` pages by the number of visible months.

```tsx
// Multi-month calendar for date range selection
<Calendar visibleDuration={{ months: 2 }} pageBehavior="visible" />
```

### FileField

The `<FileField>` component now supports a `name` prop, making it straightforward to include file uploads in standard HTML forms.

### Width Prop on Input Components

The `width` prop has been moved from `FieldBase` to individual input components (`TextField`, `Select`, `TextArea`, `DateField`, `NumberField`, `TimeField`, `FileField`). Labels and help text can now be wider than the actual input field, improving readability for fields with long descriptions.

The width prop now handles three types of values:

- **Fixed widths** (numeric scale values like `96`, `80`): The input has a fixed size while labels and help text can extend beyond it.
- **Keyword widths** (`"fit"`, `"full"`, `"max"`): The input sizes itself based on the keyword, e.g. `"fit"` shrinks to fit its content, `"full"` takes full available width, and `"max"` uses its maximum content width.
- **Fraction widths** (like `"1/2"`, `"2/3"`): The entire field scales responsively based on the container width.

```tsx
<TextField
  label="A label that can be longer than the input"
  width={96}
  description="Help text also extends beyond the input width"
/>
```

### Mobile Tray

`<DatePicker>`, `<Menu>`, `<Autocomplete>`, `<Combobox>`, and `<Select>` now use an internal `<Tray>` component on mobile devices, providing a better touch experience with a bottom-sheet style overlay.

### Text & Headline

The `<Text>` and `<Headline>` components now support a `lineHeight` prop, giving you direct control over line height without needing custom styles.

### Form

The `<Form>` component now supports ref forwarding.

### Layout Components

`<Grid>`, `<Container>`, `<Columns>`, `<Tiles>`, and `<Center>` now support semantic spacing tokens, aligning them with the new spacing system.

## Design

- Refactored elevation shadow system to use Tailwind's built-in `shadow-*` classes with theme-defined shadow variables (`shadow-elevation-border`, `shadow-elevation-raised`, `shadow-elevation-overlay`). This provides three clear elevation levels with better maintainability.
- Z-index values have been moved from theme style files to component implementations, ensuring consistent stacking order across all themes. The stacking hierarchy remains unchanged: Toast notifications (`z-80`) above modals (`z-50`), modals above popovers/menus (`z-30`).
- Updated Admin/Master badge styling.
- Set table background color to white for improved readability.

## Documentation

- New comprehensive spacing guide explaining the semantic spacing system with visual examples.
- Added documentation for the `onAction` prop from `<Combobox>`.
- Added examples showing how to use multiselection with forms.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed `<Button>` appearing as pressed when used to expand something (e.g., in accordions or dropdowns).
- Fixed `<Checkbox>` focus styling that broke after the surface update.
- Fixed a regression where `<Container>` no longer worked correctly with `<Breakout>`.
- Fixed `<Drawer>` to take full height on small screens when positioned at top or bottom.
- Correctly applied elevation shadows across all components.
- Fixed `<NumberField>` stepper visuals when disabled via `min`/`max` constraints.
- Fixed `<Scrollable>` so scrolling works as expected when pointer hovers over it.
- Updated `react-aria` dependencies to February 2026 versions (`react-aria-components` 1.15.0, `react-stately` 3.44.0).
