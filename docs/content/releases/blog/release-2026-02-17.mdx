New year, new foundations! While the first weeks of 2026 are flying by, we've been heads-down building a stronger base for Marigold. This release brings a brand-new semantic spacing system, a refreshed surface styling, and several new components to help you build better interfaces faster.

Marigold v16.2.0 is here with exciting new features, internal improvements, and important theme changes. Let's dive in!

## Breaking Changes

### Surface Styling Refactored

The surface styling system has been completely refactored to use `background-clip` and `background-origin` for gradient borders. This improves contrast and depth across all surface-based components like inputs, cards, and dialogs.

**Migration:**

```css
/* Before */
.util-surface-raised

/* After */
.ui-surface /* uses raised elevation by default */
.ui-surface.ui-elevation-overlay /* for overlays */
```

Deprecated utilities `util-focus-*` and `util-disabled` have been removed. Use the new state utilities instead: `ui-state-focus`, `ui-state-disabled`, `ui-state-error`, `ui-state-readonly`.

### Semantic Spacing System

A new relational spacing scale has been introduced that describes the strength of relationships between elements:

| Token     | Value   | Use case                                    |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `joined`  | 0.25rem | Elements attached as a single unit          |
| `tight`   | 1rem    | Packed containers for high-density scanning |
| `related` | 2rem    | Minimal separation for related pairs        |
| `peer`    | 4rem    | Self-contained equals in the same flow      |
| `group`   | 8rem    | Logical separation between content zones    |
| `section` | 16rem   | Distinct layout sections                    |
| `context` | 32rem   | Complete contextual shift                   |

**Migration:**

```tsx
// Before
<Stack space="fieldY">
<Inline space="fieldX">

// After
<Stack space="peer">
<Inline space="related">
```

### Card

`<Card>` now uses semantic spacing. The `size="full"` prop has been replaced by the new `stretch` property. Additionally, cards now always take full width by default.

```tsx
// Before
<Card size="full">...</Card>

// After
<Card stretch>...</Card>
```

### ContextualHelp

Size variants have been removed from `<ContextualHelp>`. The component now has a single, improved default style.

### TabList

The `space` prop has been removed from `<TabList>`.

## Components

### ActionBar (alpha)

A new `<ActionBar>` component for bulk operations on selected items. It appears as a floating toolbar when users select multiple items in tables or lists. It automatically shows the selection count and provides action buttons for common operations like edit, delete, or copy.

```tsx
<ActionBar selectedItemCount={3} onClearSelection={() => clearSelection()}>
  <ActionBar.Button onPress={() => editItems()}>Edit</ActionBar.Button>
  <ActionBar.Button onPress={() => deleteItems()}>Delete</ActionBar.Button>
</ActionBar>
```

### EmptyState (beta)

The new `<EmptyState>` component provides a standardized way to display placeholder content when a view has no data to show. Use it for empty lists, search results with no matches, or initial states.

### ToggleButton & ToggleButtonGroup (alpha)

New `<ToggleButton>` and `<ToggleButtonGroup>` components allow users to toggle between states or select from a group of options. These are ideal for toolbar-style controls, view switches, and filter toggles.

### Calendar

The `<Calendar>` component has been refactored with a new API. Two new props enable multi-month calendar views:

- **`visibleDuration`**: Controls the number of visible months (1-3 months). Default: `{ months: 1 }`.
- **`pageBehavior`**: Controls navigation strategy. `'single'` pages by one month, `'visible'` pages by the number of visible months.

```tsx
// Multi-month calendar for date range selection
<Calendar visibleDuration={{ months: 2 }} pageBehavior="visible" />
```

### FileField

The `<FileField>` component now supports a `name` prop, making it straightforward to include file uploads in standard HTML forms.

### Width Prop on Input Components

The `width` prop has been moved from `FieldBase` to individual input components (`TextField`, `Select`, `TextArea`, `DateField`, `NumberField`, `TimeField`, `FileField`). Labels and help text can now be wider than the actual input field, improving readability for fields with long descriptions.

The width prop now handles three types of values:

- **Fixed widths** (numeric scale values like `96`, `80`): The input has a fixed size while labels and help text can extend beyond it.
- **Keyword widths** (`"fit"`, `"full"`, `"max"`): The input sizes itself based on the keyword, e.g. `"fit"` shrinks to fit its content, `"full"` takes full available width, and `"max"` uses its maximum content width.
- **Fraction widths** (like `"1/2"`, `"2/3"`): The entire field scales responsively based on the container width.

```tsx
<TextField
  label="A label that can be longer than the input"
  width={96}
  description="Help text also extends beyond the input width"
/>
```

### Layout Components

`<Grid>`, `<Container>`, `<Columns>`, and `<Center>` now support semantic spacing tokens, aligning them with the new spacing system.

## Design

- Refactored elevation shadow system to use Tailwind's built-in `shadow-*` classes with theme-defined shadow variables (`shadow-elevation-border`, `shadow-elevation-raised`, `shadow-elevation-overlay`). This provides three clear elevation levels with better maintainability.
- Z-index values have been moved from theme style files to component implementations, ensuring consistent stacking order across all themes. The stacking hierarchy remains unchanged: Toast notifications (`z-80`) above modals (`z-50`), modals above popovers/menus (`z-30`).
- Updated Admin/Master badge styling.
- Set table background color to white for improved readability.

## Documentation

- New comprehensive spacing guide explaining the semantic spacing system with visual examples.
- Added documentation for the `onAction` prop from `<Combobox>`.
- Added examples showing how to use multiselection with forms.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed `<Button>` appearing as pressed when used to expand something (e.g., in accordions or dropdowns).
- Fixed `<Checkbox>` focus styling that broke after the surface update.
- Fixed a regression where `<Container>` no longer worked correctly with `<Breakout>`.
- Fixed `<Drawer>` to take full height on small screens when positioned at top or bottom.
- Correctly applied elevation shadows across all components.
- Updated `react-aria` dependencies to February 2026 versions (`react-aria-components` 1.15.0, `react-stately` 3.44.0).
