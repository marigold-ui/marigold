The Design System team is currently focusing on optimising the Marigold documentation, which includes adding new and higher quality content for users as well as cleaning up and removing outdated content.

## Breaking Change

We are removing all HTML properties on our Marigold components, as these should no longer be used in the future. If a user has used the HTML properties when using Marigold, he oder she must rewrite them after the breaking change. If this is not the case you can sit back and relax.

As part of this process, the upcoming Marigold release will remove content from the documentation that is not used and should no longer be used.

Removing content from the Marigold documentation is particularly necessary if it is not relevant for our users. This ensures that the documentation is not unnecessarily "bloated" with content and thus creates more space for content that our users really need and can find more quickly.

In addition, allowing the use of HTML properties was incorrectly authorised by the Design System Team in the past. This error is hereby corrected to prevent incorrect use of Marigold components in the future.
