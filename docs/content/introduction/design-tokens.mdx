Design tokens are the foundational elements of our design system, defining key aspects of our product's visual language. They enable consistency and flexibility, allowing us to maintain a unified look and feel across all user interfaces.

Because we have two themes, you can click on the `Current Theme` in the right corner to change the theme.

## Colors

A carefully curated set of primary, secondary, and accent colors ensures our product maintains a consistent and recognizable palette.

## Typography

With a defined font family and various font sizes and weights, our typography maintains readability and hierarchy. The consistent use of typography contributes to a polished and cohesive user experience.

We have properties for

- fontSize
- fontWeight
- fontStyle
- textAlign

## Spacing

Consistent spacing ensures harmonious layouts and enhances visual flow. The defined spacing scale helps create balanced and accessible interfaces across different screen sizes.

## Radius

Standardized border radius contribute to a clean and modern design. These properties are applied to components, ensuring a cohesive appearance throughout our product.

## Alignment

Consistent alignment ensures that elements are arranged in a purposeful manner, enhancing clarity and user comprehension.

## Shadows

Subtle box shadows and inset shadows add depth and dimension to elements, enhancing the overall visual appeal and user experience.

## Breakpoints

By defining breakpoints for different screen sizes, we achieve responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various devices and orientations.
