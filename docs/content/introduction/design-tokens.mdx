Design tokens are the foundational elements of our design system, defining key aspects of our product's visual language. They enable consistency and flexibility, allowing us to maintain a unified look and feel across all user interfaces.

Because we have two themes, you can click on the `Current Theme` in the right corner to change the theme.

## Colors

A carefully curated set of primary, secondary, and accent colors ensures our product maintains a consistent and recognizable palette.

Our colors are sorted according to their use case. For example, `bg` colors are only for background used, `text` for text colors, `border` only for borders and so on.

## Typography

With a defined font family and various font sizes and weights, our typography maintains readability and hierarchy. The consistent use of typography contributes to a polished and cohesive user experience. The `Value` corresponds to the class name from Tailwind CSS.

We have tokens for:

<Tabs>
  <Tabs.Item key="fontSize" title="fontSize">
    <FontSizes />
  </Tabs.Item>
  <Tabs.Item key="fontWeight" title="fontWeight">
    <FontWeights />
  </Tabs.Item>
  <Tabs.Item key="fontStyle" title="fontStyle">
    <FontStyle />
  </Tabs.Item>
  <Tabs.Item key="textAlign" title="textAlign">
    <TextAlign />
  </Tabs.Item>
</Tabs>

### Headlines

The `<Headline>` component supports by default certain styles. They are listed as Tailwind class names.

<Headlines />

## Spacing

Consistent spacing ensures harmonious layouts and enhances visual flow. The defined spacing scale helps create balanced and accessible interfaces across different screen sizes.

<SpaceSVG />

Besides this there are percentage values available for `width` property, which is found in form components. You can use them similar to the tokens above. Here is a list of the values: [Tailwind percentage tokens](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/width#percentage-widths)

## Radius

Standardized border radius contribute to a clean and modern design. These properties are applied to components, ensuring a cohesive appearance throughout our product.

<BorderRadius />

## Alignment

Consistent alignment ensures that elements are arranged in a purposeful manner, enhancing clarity and user comprehension.

## Shadows

Subtle box shadows and inset shadows add depth and dimension to elements, enhancing the overall visual appeal and user experience.

## Breakpoints

By defining breakpoints for different screen sizes, we achieve responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various devices and orientations.
