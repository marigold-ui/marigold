Design tokens are the foundational elements of our design system, defining key aspects of our product's visual language. They enable consistency and flexibility, allowing us to maintain a unified look and feel across all user interfaces.

  Since we have two themes, the values displayed show the available tokens in
  the currently selected theme.

## Colors

A carefully curated set of primary, secondary, and accent colors ensures our product maintains a consistent and recognizable palette.

Our colors are sorted according to their use case. For example, `bg` colors
are only for background used, `text` for text colors, `border` only for
borders and so on.

## Typography

With a defined font family and various font sizes and weights, our typography maintains readability and hierarchy. The consistent use of typography contributes to a polished and cohesive user experience. The `Value` corresponds to the class name from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-size).

We have tokens for:

    <Tabs.Item id="fontWeight">Font Weight</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item id="fontStyle">Font Style</Tabs.Item>

### Headlines

The `<Headline>` component supports by default certain styles. They are listed as Tailwind class names.

## Spacing

Consistent spacing ensures harmonious layouts and enhances visual flow. The defined spacing scale helps create balanced and accessible interfaces across different screen sizes. It's used for `gap`, `padding`, `width` and `margin`.

Besides this there are percentage values available for `width` property, which is found in form components. You can use them similar to the tokens above. Here is a list of the values: [Tailwind percentage tokens](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/width#percentage-widths)

## Radius

Standardized border radius contribute to a clean and modern design. These properties are applied to components, ensuring a cohesive appearance throughout our product.

    <Tabs.Item id="alignX">Horizontal</Tabs.Item>

    <AlignmentsX />
  </Tabs.TabPanel>
  <Tabs.TabPanel id="alignY">
