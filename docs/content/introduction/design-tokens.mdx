Design tokens are the foundational elements of our design system, defining key aspects of our product's visual language. They enable consistency and flexibility, allowing us to maintain a unified look and feel across all user interfaces.

<Message variant="info">
  <Message.Title>Changing Theme</Message.Title>
  <Message.Content>
    Since we have two themes, the values displayed show the available tokens in
    the currently selected theme.

## Colors

A carefully curated set of primary, secondary, and accent colors ensures our product maintains a consistent and recognizable palette.

Our colors are sorted according to their use case. For example, `bg` colors
are only for background used, `text` for text colors, `border` only for
borders and so on.

If you are not sure which token to use, please visit our [design token guideline page](./design-tokens)

## Typography

With a defined font family and various font sizes and weights, our typography maintains readability and hierarchy. The consistent use of typography contributes to a polished and cohesive user experience.
For formatting dates or numbers we already have some helper components: [NumericFormat](../components/formatters/numericformat/numericFormat), [DateFormat](../components/formatters/dateformat/dateFormat).

The `Value` corresponds to the class name from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-size).

We have tokens for:

<Tabs>
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Item id="fontSize">Font Size</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item id="fontWeight">Font Weight</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item id="fontStyle">Font Style</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item id="textAlign">Text Align</Tabs.Item>
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.TabPanel id="fontSize">
    <FontSizes />
  </Tabs.TabPanel>
  <Tabs.TabPanel id="fontWeight">
    <FontWeights />
  </Tabs.TabPanel>
  <Tabs.TabPanel id="fontStyle">
    <FontStyle />
  </Tabs.TabPanel>
  <Tabs.TabPanel id="textAlign">
    <TextAlign />
  </Tabs.TabPanel>
</Tabs>

### Headlines

The `<Headline>` component supports by default certain styles. They are listed as Tailwind class names.

<Headlines />

## Spacing

Consistent spacing ensures harmonious layouts and enhances visual flow. The defined spacing scale helps create balanced and accessible interfaces across different screen sizes. It's used for `gap`, `padding`, `width` and `margin`.

<Spacing />

Besides this there are percentage values available for `width` property, which is found in form components. You can use them similar to the tokens above. Here is a list of the values: [Tailwind percentage tokens](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/width#percentage-widths)

## Radius

Standardized border radius contribute to a clean and modern design. These properties are applied to components, ensuring a cohesive appearance throughout our product.

<BorderRadius />

## Alignment

Consistent alignment ensures that elements are arranged in a purposeful manner, enhancing clarity and user comprehension.

<Tabs>
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Item id="alignX">Horizontal</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item id="alignY">Vertical</Tabs.Item>
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.TabPanel id="alignX">
    <AlignmentsX />
  </Tabs.TabPanel>
  <Tabs.TabPanel id="alignY">
    <AlignmentsY />
  </Tabs.TabPanel>
</Tabs>

## Breakpoints

By defining breakpoints for different screen sizes, we achieve responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various devices and orientations.
