## Specific questions

If you have a question that needs more explanation, feel free to ask for a meeting or a pairing session in our channel. It helps us grasp your issue better when we have enough time and focus. Your questions matter to us, and we want to give them the attention they deserve.

Examples for this kind of question are:

- when you are not sure if you used ... and want someone to review your implementation, or
-

- I am not sure if I build this right. Can someone do a code review?

- something special with your settings/ application
- a complicated case which is hard to write down
