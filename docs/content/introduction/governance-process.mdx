Our governance process ensures that any changes or additions to the design system are carefully evaluated to maintain consistency, stability, and user-friendliness. We prioritize updates that meet specific user needs, adhere to industry standards, and offer high reusability. This approach, guided by our Governance Values and Principles [link to docs], helps us uphold the quality and integrity of our design system.

To this regard, we have created a flowchart which is divided into 3 phases, that illustrates how we deal with these features and additions.

## Phase 1: Product Team Discovers a Problem

The product team which is using Marigold runs into a problem or some limitations in its use.

  <div>
    **Step 1:** The process begins when the product team discovers a problem with
    Marigold, which could be, for example, a missing, broken, or
    non-user-friendly component.

    **Step 2:** They should ask themselves the question if the Design System offers an existing alternative to the problem.

    - **Yes:** If a viable alternative exists within the design system, the product team should use it.

    - **No:** If there is no viable alternative, the product team should write a request ([support portal (internal only)](https://reservix.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/77)).

    If the product team writes a [Jira Support Ticket (internal only)](https://reservix.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/77), this triggers phase 2.

## Phase 2: Design System Team Evaluates the Request

This phase is only relevant if the product team has written a Jira Support Ticket (internal only). The process starts when a support ticket is received.

    <Columns columns={[5, 5]} space={4}>
        <div>
            **Step 1:** If we have received a request through our support portal (internal only) we have to check if there is clear evidence of user need:

            - **Yes:** If there is clear evidence of user need, move to the next step.

            - **No:** If there isn't clear evidence, the request is declined, and alternative solutions are offered.

        </div>

    </Columns>
    <Columns columns={[5, 5]} space={4}>
        <div>
            **Step 2:** The next decision we have to make is that we have to check if the requested change feel familiar to our users.

            - **Yes:** If the requested change will feel familiar to users, move to the next step.

            - **No:** If it won't feel familiar, the request is declined, and alternative solutions are offered.

         </div>
    </Columns>
    <Columns columns={[5, 5]} space={4}>
        <div>
        **Step 3:** We have to check if the change is likely to be reusable across multiple products.

        - **Yes:** If the change is likely to be reusable across multiple products, we approve the request.

        - **No:** If it isn't likely to be reusable, the request is declined, and alternative solutions are offered.

        <div className="overflow-hidden">
          <Image width={700} height={900} className="hover:scale-125 transition ease-in-out " src="/governance-phase2-3.png" />
        </div>
    </Columns>
    <Columns columns={[5, 5]} space={4}>
        <div>

            **Step 4:** The next step is to determine the estimated timeline, including the roadmap and estimated effort.

            **Step 5:** We have to ask ourselves, if the estimated timeline suits for the product teams.

            - **Yes:** If the estimated timeline works for the product team, the product team waits for delivery and will process with “Phase 3a”.

            - **No:** If the estimated timeline does not work, the process goes to "Phase 3b".
