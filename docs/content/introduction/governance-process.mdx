Product teams are primarily focused on getting the job done. In their quest to achieve this, they might resort to improvising styles, crafting unique components, or even bypassing the design system entirely. To prevent this, we've established a governance process that guides both the product teams and us on managing changes and additions within Marigold.

This process ensures that any modifications to the design system are carefully evaluated to maintain consistency, stability, and user-friendliness. We prioritize updates that meet specific user needs, adhere to industry standards, and offer high reusability. Guided by our Governance Values and Principles, this approach helps uphold the quality and integrity of our design system.

If you ever asked yourself what we do with your requests or what you should do if we rejected your request, you've come to the right place.

We have created a flowchart which is divided into 3 phases, that illustrates how we deal with these features and additions you requested.

## Phase 1: Product team discovers a problem

What should you do if you run into a problem or some limitations while using Marigold?

<Columns columns={[5, 5]} space={4}>
  <div>
    **Step 1:** The process begins when the product team discovers a problem with
    Marigold, which could be, for example, a missing, broken, or
    non-user-friendly component.

    **Step 2:** They should first ask themselves whether the Design System offers an existing alternative to solve the problem.

    - **Yes:** If a viable alternative exists within the design system, the product team should use it.

    - **No:** If there is no viable alternative, the product team should write a request ([support portal (internal only)](https://reservix.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/77)).

    If the product team writes a [Jira Support Ticket (internal only)](https://reservix.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/77), this triggers phase 2.

  </div>
</Columns>

## Phase 2: Design system team evaluates the request

This phase is only relevant if you have written a [Jira Support Ticket (internal only)](https://reservix.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/77). In this phase you get to know what happen to your request and how we proceed with it.

<Stack space={4}>
    <Columns columns={[5, 5]} space={4}>
        <div>
            **Step 1:** If we have received a request through our [support portal (internal only)](https://reservix.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/77) we have to check if there is clear evidence of user need:

            - **Yes:** If there is clear evidence of user need, move to the next step.

            - **No:** If there isn't clear evidence, the request is declined, and alternative solutions are offered.

        </div>
        <div className="overflow-hidden">
           <Image width={700} height={900} className="hover:scale-125 transition ease-in-out " src="/governance-phase2-1.png" />
        </div>

    </Columns>
    <Columns columns={[5, 5]} space={4}>
        <div>
            **Step 2:** For the next decision we have to check if the requested change feel familiar to our users.

            - **Yes:** If the requested change will feel familiar to users, move to the next step.

            - **No:** If it won't feel familiar the request is declined and alternative solutions are offered.
        </div>
        <div className="overflow-hidden">
          <Image width={700} height={900} className="hover:scale-125 transition ease-in-out " src="/governance-phase2-2.png" />
         </div>
    </Columns>
    <Columns columns={[5, 5]} space={4}>
        <div>
        **Step 3:** We have to check if the change is likely to be reusable across multiple products.

        - **Yes:** If the change is likely to be reusable across multiple products, we approve the request.

        - **No:** If it isn't likely to be reusable, the request is declined, and alternative solutions are offered.
        </div>
        <div className="overflow-hidden">
          <Image width={700} height={900} className="hover:scale-125 transition ease-in-out " src="/governance-phase2-3.png" />
        </div>
    </Columns>
    <Columns columns={[5, 5]} space={4}>
        <div>
            **Step 4:** The next step is to determine the estimated timeline, including the roadmap and estimated effort.

            **Step 5:** We have to ask ourselves, if the estimated timeline suits for the product teams.

            - **Yes:** If the estimated timeline works for the product team, the product team waits for delivery and will process with ‚ÄúPhase 3a‚Äù.

            - **No:** If the estimated timeline does not work, the process goes to "Phase 3b".

            <div className="overflow-hidden">
             <Image width={700} height={900} className="hover:scale-125 transition ease-in-out " src="/governance-phase2-4.png" />
            </div>
    </Columns>

## Phase 3a: Design system team fulfills the request

This phase can only be achieved if the estimated time for the request is acceptable for you and your team and you are willing to wait for us to deliver it.

<Columns columns={[5, 5]} space={4}>
  <div>
    **Step 1:** We start designing the request or addition if needed.

    **Step 2:** Does the design fulfills [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) requirements:

    - **Yes:** If the result meets [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) requirements, proceed to testing.

    - **No:** If it does not meet these requirements, the design process must be revisited.

    **Step 3:** Test the design in real-world environments, ideally with real users.

    **Step 4:** We need to check if the solution meets the three key criteria: user need, familiarity, and reusability.

    - **Yes:** If it meets all three criteria, proceed to the voting stage in next step.

    - **No:** If it does not meet the criteria, iterate on the design.

    **Step 5:** The Design System Team and major stakeholders (e.g., UX/UI teams) vote on the solution. Is there agreement?

    - **Yes:** If there is consensus, proceed to documentation.

    - **No:** If there is no consensus, revisit the design and address concerns.

    **Step 6:** We document the approved changes.

    **Step 7:** We merge the changes to the codebase.

    **Step 8:** We communicate the change or addition.

## Phase 3b: Product team‚Äôs response if request can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt be fulfilled

What if you cannot wait for us to deliver a request? Well, than you have to follow this process.

<Columns columns={[5, 5]} space={4}>
<div>
    **Step 1:**  We need to know if the product team is still convinced of the need for the request.

    - **Yes:** If the product team is still convinced of the need for the request, they proceed to the next step.

    - **No:** If the product team is no longer convinced of the need for the request, the process ends, and the product team re-examines their requirements.

    **Step 2:** If the product team is still convinced of the need for the request, they begin building their own component or solution, receiving support from the design system team.

    **Step 3:** Throughout the development process, the product team frequently coordinates with the design system team to ensure alignment and adherence to guidelines.

    **Step 4:** The product team ensures that all design tokens and sub-elements used in their solution are sourced from the design system to maintain consistency.

    **Step 5:** The product team takes ownership of the custom solution they have developed. They document the solution and maintain it.

    **Step 6:** In the course of time we need to reflect if there has a viable existing alternative in Marigold become available?

    - **Yes:** If a viable alternative becomes available in the design system, the product team removes their custom solution and implements the official one.

    - **No:** If there is still no alternative available in the design system the product team continue to maintain their custom solution.

<Message messageTitle="End of process">
    With end of Phase 3a the request is fulfilled and the process of making changes and additions is done. üéâ

    In Phase 3b, the process concludes either with the product team maintaining the change or awaiting an alternative solution from the Design System Team.
