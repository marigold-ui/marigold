To integrate Marigold into your React app, follow the steps outlined below. Marigold provides a wide range of pre-designed UI components. However, Marigold's components come with no styling by default. To ensure a perfect fit with your product's appearance, you must also install one of the predefined themes.

Please bear in mind that certain steps may vary depending on your specific setup. You can find examples for the most common setups down below.

## 1. Installation

Begin by instaling the core Marigold package (`@marigold/components`) into your app using your preferred package manager. This package is always required, regardless of the theme you choose to apply later.

Execute the following command in your project's directory:

<Tabs>
  <Tabs.Item key="npm" title="npm">

    {/* prettier-ignore */}
    ```bash
    npm install @marigold/components --save
    ```

  </Tabs.Item>
  <Tabs.Item key="pnpm" title="pnpm">

    {/* prettier-ignore */}
    ```bash
    pnpm add @marigold/components
    ```

  </Tabs.Item>
  <Tabs.Item key="yarn" title="yarn">

    {/* prettier-ignore */}
    ```bash
    yarn add @marigold/components
    ```

  </Tabs.Item>
</Tabs>

## 2. Theming

As mentioned earlier, Marigold components come without any styles by default. To customize their appearance, you can choose from the existing themes listed below:

- **b2b:** Ideal for developing new standalone software applications.
- **core:** Suitable for developing or refactoring components within the Reservix System.

Selecting a theme will enable you to seamlessly apply a consistent look and feel to all components, ensuring they harmonize with the rest of your app. Each theme comes as its own package:

- `@marigold/theme-b2b` will give you the appearance for standalone software.
- `@marigold/theme-core` will match the look and feel of the Reservix System.

Once you have decided on a theme, proceed to install it using your preferred package manager, similar to the way you installed the `@marigold/components` package earlier.

## 3. Tooling

Marigold effortlessly integrates with popular bundlers such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), and [vite](https://vitejs.dev/), as well as frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), without requiring any additional configurations.

-> we suggest nextjs, not CRA

If you are using TypeScript, ensure that you add `@types/react` and `@react/types-dom` to your project. Marigold's components are fully typed, enabling you to benefit from static type checking and IDE autocomplete features for enhanced development efficiency.

## Tooling

_Marigold_ works with popular build tools, like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/).

If you are using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to build your app, be sure to add [@types/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react) and [@types/react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react-dom) to your project. _Marigold_ is written in TypeScript and Marigold components are published with their type definitions so that you can take advantage of static type checking and IDE autocomplete.

## Bootstrapping

For _Marigold_ to work correctly, you need to wrap your app with the `MarigoldProvider`. This way _Marigold_ components will be able to access styles and SSR will work out of the box.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button, MarigoldProvider } from '@marigold/components';
import theme from '@marigold/theme-b2b';

const App = () => (
  <MarigoldProvider theme={theme}>
    <Button variant="primary" onClick={() => alert('Hey there!')}>
      Hello World
    </Button>
  </MarigoldProvider>
);
```

See the [Provider](../components/provider) and [Button](../components/button) docs for more information about the components used in this example.
