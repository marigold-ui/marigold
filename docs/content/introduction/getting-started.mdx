# Getting Started

## What is Marigold?

*Marigold* is a React implementation of Reservix' design language. It provides a declarative way to build user interfaces which are adaptive to screen sizes and accessibility.

## Installation

To install Marigold you can use package managers like [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

**With npm:**
```bash onlyCode
npm install @marigold/components
```

**With yarn:**
```bash onlyCode
yarn add @marigold/components
```

In addition to the components, you usually want to install an existing [theme](/introduction/theming).

ðŸ’¬  Please note that [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) >= 17.0.0 and [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) >= 17.0.0 are peer dependencies.

## Tooling

*Marigold* works with popular build tools, like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/).

If you are using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to build your app, be sure to add [@types/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react) and [@types/react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react-dom) to your project. *Marigold* is written in TypeScript and Marigold components are published with their type definitions so that you can take advantage of static type checking and IDE autocomplete.

## Bootstrapping

For *Marigold* to work correctly, you need to wrap your app with the `MarigoldProvider`. This way *Marigold* components will be able to access styles and SSR will work out of the box.

```jsx onlyCode
import React from 'react';
import { Button, MarigoldProvider } from '@marigold/components';
import theme from '@marigold/theme-unicorn';

const App = () =>  (
  <MarigoldProvider theme={theme}>
    <Button variant="primary" onClick={alert('Hey there!')}>
      Hello World
    </Button>
  </MarigoldProvider>
);
```

See the [Provider](../components/provider) and [Button](../components/button) docs for more information about the components used in this example.
