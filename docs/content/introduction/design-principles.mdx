Design principles guide the creation of cohesive, user-friendly software applications. They define and communicate key product characteristics to stakeholders, including clients, colleagues, and team members. By setting clear goals, design principles ensure that all decisions align, keeping the products in harmony and focused.

## Familarity

Leverage existing mental models by aligning interfaces with familiar patterns and industry standards. Ensure consistency with widely recognized design conventions to reduce cognitive load and promote predictability in user interactions.

This approach minimizes the learning curve of our users and make the user experience of our applications intuitive and seamless, enabling users to act with confidence.

## Simplicity

Ensure each design element has a clear purpose and keeps things simple. Focus on what users need, avoiding extra features or decorations. Design with intent, solving specific problems and improving the user experience. Break complex tasks into smaller steps in order to decrease cognitive load.

Reducing the number and complexity of choices helps users make decisions and accomplish tasks with greater accuracy and speed, thus reducing errors and enhancing productivity.

## Sustainable

Design should create meaningful benefits for users and stakeholders while being economically sustainable. Focus on developing solutions that meet user needs effectively and efficiently, ensuring that the design contributes to the overall success and viability of the product.

Focusing on sustainability ensures the product's longevity and continued value to users, avoiding the trap of local optimization that fails to deliver meaningful benefits.

## Clarity

Feedback serves as a vital link between users and software applications. It should be prompt, meaningful, and perceivable so that users know their actions were detected. The connection between the action and the result should be clear, helping users understand what happened, why it happened, and what they should do next.

By providing users with this information, they can make informed decisions, avoid errors, and efficiently complete tasks. Good feedback simplifies and supports the userâ€™s experience instead of complicating it.
