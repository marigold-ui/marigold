## What is a design system?

Let's get something out of the way: the idea of reusable UI elements is not new. Style guides, UI kits and pattern libraries exist for well over a decade. And at least since Brad Frost's [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology, designers and developers agree on the concept of components to encapsulate visual and functional properties of discrete user interface pieces.

However, a _design system_ is not only a collection of the assets and components you use to build your product. According to Emmet Connolly, director of product design at Intercom, a design system is not just “a big box of UI Lego pieces that can be assembled in near-infinite ways. All the pieces may be consistent, but that doesn't mean the assembled results will be. Your product is more than just a pile of reusable UI elements. It has structure and meaning. It's not a generic web page, it's the embodiment of a system of concepts.”

In Short:

> "[A design system is ] a set of multidisciplinary shared, integrated principles and patterns that define the overall design of the product"
> – [Karri Saarinen ex-Design Systems Lead @ Airbnb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuLY1cYM57g)

So what sets a design system apart from something like a pattern library is that it is build with clear rules, constraints and principles, implemented in design and code. Ideally, it will convey your business identity and philosophy as well as strengthen the relationship of users with your brand.

That said, one of the primary benefits of a design system is the ability to quickly replicate designs, while removing the burden of developers to adhere to design specifications. Your marketers, designers and developers can collaborate quickly to produce the experience your customers wants, while maintaining the consistency your brand needs.

And because markets and customer demands constantly change, a design system is not just an artifact of a design process. It is a living, funded product with a roadmap and backlog, serving an ecosystem.

## Why is component X missing?

We are constantly working on the design system and its components.
We write primarily atomic and molecular reusable components ([AtomicDesign - Brad Frost](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/)). Our mission is to support all software development teams. This is why wo do not create team specfific components. If some typically used component is missing, then it could have one of the following reasons:

- The component already exists and we are in the process of improving it
- We are currently in the developing process the component
- We are currently in the design process of the component
- We plan to develop the component in the further future
- We do not have the component in planning at the moment
- The component is too complex or unique to develop at the moment
