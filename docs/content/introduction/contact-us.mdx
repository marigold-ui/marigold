Through the usage of Marigold many questions and feature requests reach us. We always try to be a good point of contact for you.

First we would thank you to checkout our existing documentation from Marigold before you contact us. It is always good to explore the content of this website, it may help you with our problem.

Also you can have a look on our [FAQ's ](./faq) and [About us](./about) page.

You find alternative contact possibilities below.

## If you have a general question:

If you have a general question regarding Marigold or the Design-System, you should ask this in our Slack Channel [#design-system](https://reservix.slack.com/archives/C02727BNZ3J).

That can be for example:

- Where can I find the Marigold Figma File?
- What is the need of a specific property?
- Do you know how to align elements in `<Inline>`?
- ...

We want to create a community feeling in the channel, so feel free to help other people as well! 🙂

## If you have a specific question:

If you have a question which regards more explaination, you should ask for a meeting in the Channel. It’s easier for us to understand your current problem better. It’s better for us to gather enough time and focus on your problem.

For example:

- something special with your settings/ application
- a complicated case which is hard to write down
- code review
- ...
