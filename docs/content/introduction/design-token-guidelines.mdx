## Naming Convention

Knowing how to read token names helps you find the right token quickly in both designs and code.

The name of a design token describes how it should be used, with each part indicating a specific aspect of its usage. Our tokens consist of the following parts:

1. **Property:** The property of an UI element the token should be applied to, like a background, text or border.
2. **Intent:** Identifies different use cases for a token. For example, to indicate user feedback or visual hierachy.
3. **Modifier:** Additional details about the token's purpose. In most cases, this is an interaction state, but it can also indicate where, contextually, the token should be applied (e.g. "raised" in the surface tokens). The `DEFAULT` modifier can be omitted.

## Color Tokens

Color tokens leverage the primitive tokens that form the color palettes of our design system. They provide a systematic approach to managing and applying colors consistently across various elements, while ensuring a cohesive and harmonious visual identity.

### Text

**Property Name:** `text`

Text tokens are used to apply specific colors to text, equivalent to the `color` CSS rule or the [text utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/text-color) in TailwindCSS.

#### Intents

Below, you'll find all the available intents for the text tokens:

- **base:** Default values for a specific category of tokens, serving as the foundational colors
- **inverted:** Alternative default values used when the base color lacks sufficient contrast ratio, ensuring accessibility
- **brand:** Represents the primary brand color of the company, establishing a consistent visual identity
- **accent:** Signifies the accent brand color, adding emphasis and vibrancy to the overall design
- **info:** Represents a feedback color conveying auxiliary information, providing additional context
- **success:** Serves as a feedback color to indicate successful actions or positive outcomes
- **warning:** Functions as a feedback color, drawing attention to situations where user intervention is required
- **error:** Functions as a feedback color in situations of errors or destructive actions, signaling potential issues

#### Modifiers

The following modifier can be applied to all the aforementioned intents:

- **DEFAULT:** Default color for text
- **hover:** Color when text is hovered with a mouse
- **disabled:** Color when text is used in a disabled control or field (only available when using the "base" or "inverted" intent)

### Background

**Property Name:** `bg`

Background tokens are used to apply specific colors to the background of an element. They are equivalent to the `background-color` CSS rule or the [bg utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-color) in TailwindCSS.

#### Intents

Background tokens incorporate the same intents as text tokens (base, inverted, brand, accent, info, success, warning, error) and have the following additional intents:

- **selected:** Indicates that a specific item from a list or option is chosen
- **surface:** Functions as the background for a particular surface level

#### Modifiers

The following modifier can be applied to all a background token:

- **DEFAULT:** Default background color
- **hover:** Applied when an element is hovered with a mouse (not available when using the "selected" intent)
- **active:** Applied when an element is active, such as when a button is pressed (not available when using the "selected" intent)
- **disabled:** Utilized for indicating that an element is disabled (only available when using the "base" or "inverted" intent)
- **input:** Used for inputs that require a more prominent visual appearance, such as radio buttons, checkboxes, and switches (only available when using the "selected" intent)

The "surface" intent is used to create visual hierachy. Because of this it has distinct modifiers compared to the other background intents. Only the following modifiers can be used with it:

- **DEFAULT:** Applied to elements that represent the basline for all other surface layers, like the `<body>` element
- **raised:** Used for elevated surfaces, such as cards
- **overlay:** Applied to surfaces with significant height, like popovers
- **sunken:** Applied to surface that creates a backdrop

### Border

**Property Name:** `border`

Border tokens are used to apply specific colors to the border of an element. They are equivalent to the `border-color` CSS rule or the [border utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/border-color) in TailwindCSS.

#### Intents

Border tokens incorporate the same intents as text tokens (base, inverted, brand, accent, info, success, warning, error) and have the following additional intents:

- **selected:** Indicates that a specific item from a list or option is chosen

#### Modifiers

The following modifier can be applied to all a border token:

- **DEFAULT:** Default border color
- **hover:** Applied when an element is hovered with a mouse
- **active:** Applied when an element is active, such as when a button is pressed
- **disabled:** Utilized for indicating that an element is disabled (only available when using the "base" or "inverted" intent)

### Outline

**Property Name:** `outline`

Outline tokens are used to apply specific colors for the outline of an element. They are equivalent to the `outline-color` CSS rule or the [outline utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/outline-color) in TailwindCSS.

#### Intents

Outline tokens have a special use case and should be used sparingly. Their usage is reserved for indicating keyboard navigation:

- **focus:** Apply when an element is focused, particularly with keyboard navigation

There are no modifiers for outline tokens.

## Effect Tokens

Effects serve various purposes, both aesthetic and functional. They can indicate interactivity, such as making a button appear clickable with a shadow. Additionally, effects encompass background filters like blur and animations.

### Shadow

**Property Name:** `shadow`

Shadow tokens are used to apply specific shadow to an element. They are equivalent to the `box-shadow` CSS rule or the [shadow utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/box-shadow) in TailwindCSS.

#### Intents

Shadow tokens have the following intents:

- **surface:** Functions as the background for a particular surface level

#### Modifiers

- **DEFAULT:** Applied to elements that represent the basline for all other surface layers, like the `<body>` element
- **raised:** Used for elevated surfaces, such as cards
- **overlay:** Applied to surfaces with significant height, like popovers
- **sunken:** Applied to surface that creates a backdrop

## Number Tokens

Number tokens encompass properties represented by numerical values, contributing to the management of elements such as white space and typography sizes. They play a crucial role in creating hierarchy and vertical rhythm.

### Component Height

**Property Name:** `component`

Component tokens assist in sizing elements and ensuring consistency across the design system, promoting a unified and harmonious visual presentation. This is particularly relevant for creating effective and aesthetically pleasing forms.

<Message messageTitle="Not mandatory" variant="info">
  The relevance of height is limited to specific components. In numerous cases,
  a component's size must align with its contents. Therefore, the use of tokens
  is not obligatory in every instance.
</Message>

#### Intents

Intents for component tokens encompass attributes that foster consistency across various elements. There are the following intents:

- **height**: Specifies the height of an element

#### Modifiers

The following modifiers can be used:

- **DEFAULT:** Serves as the base height for form components.
- **sm:** Applied to display a small components.
- **lg:** Applied to display a large components.

### Height

**Property Name:** `h`

Height tokens are used to apply specific height to an element. They are equivalent to the `height` CSS rule or the [height utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/height) in TailwindCSS.

There are no semantic values assigned to these tokens, as their usage does not necessitate them. This is because the primary focus of these tokens is on visual styling rather than conveying specific semantic meaning. Additionally, the tokens often serve as a direct representation of their intended visual outcome, eliminating the need for additional semantic values.

Height tokens follow a 4-pixel grid convention, implying that their values are adjusted in increments of 4 pixels. Each token represents a multiplier of that grid. For example, a value of 2 would equate to 8 pixels.

### Width

**Property Name:** `w`

Width tokens are used to apply specific width to an element. They are equivalent to the `width` CSS rule or the [width utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/width) in TailwindCSS.

There are no semantic values assigned to these tokens, as their usage does not necessitate them. This is because the primary focus of these tokens is on visual styling rather than conveying specific semantic meaning.
