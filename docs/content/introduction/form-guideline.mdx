## Marigold Form Components

Form components are individual elements that make up a form, such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, select fields, text areas and buttons. They allow user input, selection and actions.

## Field Anatomy

An accessible form input includes a clear label associated with its corresponding form control (`<input>`, `<select>`, ...). Additional guidance is provided by a help text, which can give additional context or instructions or display a descriptive messages.

<Image
  src="/field.png"
  alt="Anatomy of a field"
  width={300}
  height={150}
  className="mx-auto block"
/>

Marigold's form components allow to set these properties like shown below. All form components allow to set a `label`, `description` and `errorMessages` besides some additional control-specific props.

```tsx
<TextField
  label="Promo Code"
  description="You can find the code on the back of your ticket."
  errorMessage="The promo code was already used."
/>
```
