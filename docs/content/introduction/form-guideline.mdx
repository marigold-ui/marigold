## Marigold Form Components

Form components are individual elements that make up a form, such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, select fields, text areas and buttons. They allow user input, selection and actions.

Marigold has a set of form components that you can use to build your form.

- [Button](/components/form/button)
- [Calendar](/components/form/calendar)
- [Checkbox](/components/form/checkbox)
- [ComboBox](/components/form/combobox)
- [DateField](/components/form/datefield)
- [DatePicker](/components/form/datepicker)
- [FieldGroup](/components/form/fieldgroup)
- [NumberField](/components/form/number-field)
- [Radio](/components/form/radio)
- [SearchField](/components/form/search-field)
- [Select](/components/form/select)
- [Slider](/components/form/slider)
- [Switch](/components/form/switch)
- [TextArea](/components/form/text-area)
- [TextField](/components/form/text-field)

## Field Anatomy

An accessible form input includes a clear label associated with its corresponding form control (`<input>`, `<select>`, ...). Additional guidance is provided by a help text, which can give additional context or instructions or display a descriptive messages.

  width={300}
  height={150}
  className="mx-auto block"
/>

Marigold's form components allow to set these properties like shown below. All form components allow to set a `label`, `description` and `errorMessages` besides some additional control-specific props.

## Label and Help Text

Labels are essential for accessibility and clarity, ensuring that each form field is clearly defined. In most cases, a label should be provided for each form control to describe the expected input.

However, in some specific cases, such as in search bars or simple forms with obvious context, labels might be omitted in favor of alternatives like `aria-label` for accessibility.

Helper Text, on the other hand, should complement the label by providing additional context or validation message.

### Field States

Form components often exist in various states to indicate how they should behave or be interacted with. These states provide important context for users and ensure proper handling of inputs in different senarios. Below are the common field states used in forms.
