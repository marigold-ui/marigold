Design principles guide the creation of cohesive, user-friendly software applications. They define and communicate key product characteristics to stakeholders, including clients, colleagues, and team members. By setting clear goals, design principles ensure that all decisions align, keeping the products in harmony and focused.

## Familiarity

Leverage existing mental models by aligning interfaces with familiar patterns and industry standards. Ensure consistency with widely recognized design conventions to reduce cognitive load and promote predictability in user interactions.

This approach minimizes the learning curve of our users and make the user experience of our applications intuitive and seamless, enabling users to act with confidence.

## Simplicity

Ensure each design element has a clear purpose and keeps things simple. Focus on what users need, avoiding extra features or decorations. Design with intent, solving specific problems and improving the user experience. Break complex tasks into smaller steps in order to decrease cognitive load.

Reducing the number and complexity of choices helps users make decisions and accomplish tasks with greater accuracy and speed, thus reducing errors and enhancing productivity.

## Clarity

The connection between a user's action and its result should be clear. Helping users understand what happened, why it happened, and what they should do next is a vital part of effective interface design. By making interactions within the application unambiguous, users gain confidence as they always know what is happening and why.

This allows user to make informed decisions, avoid errors, and efficiently complete tasks. Clarity should simplify and support the user's experience instead of complicating it.
