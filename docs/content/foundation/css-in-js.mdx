# CSS in Javascript

## What's CSS-in-JS?

CSS-in-JS follows the principle that you pack your CSS styles directly into your components instead of Stylesheets.
You can author CSS in JavaScript syntax and take advantage of anything from the JS ecosystem.
Marigold uses the CSS-in-JS-Library called [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).
CSS-in-JS is in fact a JavaScript library that bundles each JavaScript component with all its belonging CSS rules and dependencies.

## Why do we use CSS-in-JS?

### Scoped CSS

All CSS-in-JS libs are creating automatically unique names for css classes.
The styles which are applied in Marigold components are applied only to the respective component.
Styling outside the component remains completely unaffected by them.
This prevents the collision of css classnames and reduces the struggle in finding a suitable classname.

### No inline styles

With CSS-in-JS, no styles are assigned within the HTML. We are using **no style props** like `<div style={{ padding: '8px' }}>`
This gives us the following advantages: Responsive designs which are not possible using inline styles can be used with CSS-in-JS.
Furthermore, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements and media queries can be used.
In addition, inline styles are generally considered to be less performant than classnames.

### Server-Side-Rendering

The Marigold Design-System is generated with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and supports SSR.
During SSR, only the styles necessary to render the initial view are added to the HTML document. Dynamic styles are removed to reduce the amount of code.
This has a positive effect on performance, because there is no separate CSS file that has to be retrieved from the server to block the rendering process.

### The className property

Marigold theme styles are applied with a classname. Emotion outputs the classnames as a string that can then be assigned to HTML elements like this:
`<button class='css-ase7ea css-1nt0tt7'>`.
The principle is to define styles first and then apply it to the component which should be styled.

## Whats CSS-in-JS not?

CSS-in-JS does not get rid of the need to understand the following:

- How styles are applied to the DOM
- How inheritance works
- How CSS properties work
- How CSS layout works
