# Box Primitive

## Box as Layout Component

As the basis of all our components, we use the `<Box>`. It is a versatile layout component that
can be modified with layout props as listed in the <Link to="../../components/box">Box component</Link> description.
Additionally, use the `variant` prop to define custom styles in your themes. With the `as` prop, you
determine the rendered HTML element.

```tsx code
import { Box } from '@marigold/components';
```

```tsx live
<Box as="button" bg="orange" p="8px">
  Button box with backgroundcolor and padding!
</Box>
```

## Building a new Component with the Box

In case you want to build your own custom component, use the Box as the underlying layout component and add
the styles accordingly. You can stack and nest multiple Box instances and build your complex component like this.
