# Box Primitive

## Box as Layout Component

As the basis of all our components, we use the `<Box>`. It is a versatile layout component that
can be modified with layout props as listed in the [Box component](../../components/box) description.
Additionally, use the `variant` prop to define custom styles in your themes. With the `as` prop, you
determine the rendered HTML element. Instead of exposing the underlying tools that will create CSS, the `<Box>` component
wraps them and exposes an API for applying styling to a component while respecting the rules and constraints of our design
system.

```tsx onlyCode
import { Box } from '@marigold/components';
import { useStyles } from '@marigold/system';
```

```tsx expandCode
<Box as="button" bg="orange" p="8px">
  Button box with backgroundcolor and padding
</Box>
```

## Building a custom Component with the Box

In case you want to build your own custom component, use the `Box` as the underlying layout component and add
the styles accordingly. You can stack and nest multiple Box instances and build your complex component like this.
By default, the `Box` component will render a `<div />`. This might be fine most of the times, but sometimes you would
rather render a `<button>` or an `<input>` etc. To allow this, the `Box` takes the special prop called `as`, accepting
all HTML tag names as input. Don't forget to define variants in your theme.

```tsx onlyCode
export type ButtonProps = {
  variant?: string;
} & ComponentPropsWithRef<'button'>;

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  variant = 'primary.large',
  children,
  ...props
}) => {
  return (
    <Box as="button" {...props} variant={`button.${variant}`}>
      <Box as="span" display="inline-flex" alignItems="center">
        {children}
      </Box>
    </Box>
  );
};
```

## Custom CSS

Staying inside the boundaries of the design system and its contraints should be the norm. But as limiting styling only
to allowed values defined by the system can be very restrictive, you can use the `className` prop and generate custom
styles with the [`useStyles`](../../guides/usestyles) hook.

```tsx onlyCode
...
    <Box
      as="button"
      className={useStyles({ css: { fontSize: '11pt' } })}
      {...props}
      variant={`button.${variant}`}
    >
      ...
    </Box>
...
```
