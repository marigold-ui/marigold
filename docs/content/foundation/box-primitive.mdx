# Box Primitive

## Box as Layout Component

As the basis of all our components, we use the `<Box>`. It is a versatile layout component that
can be modified with layout props as listed in the <Link to="../../components/box">Box component</Link> description.
Additionally, use the `variant` prop to define custom styles in your themes. With the `as` prop, you
determine the rendered HTML element. Instead of exposing the underlying tools that will create CSS, the `<Box>` component
wraps them and exposes an API for applying styling to a component while respecting the rules and constraints of our design
system.

```tsx code
import { Box } from '@marigold/components';
```

```tsx live
<Box as="button" bg="orange" p="8px">
  Button box with backgroundcolor and padding!
</Box>
```

## Building a custom Component with the Box

In case you want to build your own custom component, use the `Box` as the underlying layout component and add
the styles accordingly. You can stack and nest multiple Box instances and build your complex component like this.
By default, the `Box` component will render a `<div />`. This might be fine most of the times, but sometimes you would
rather render a `<button>` or an `<input>` etc. To allow this, the `Box` takes the special prop called `as`, accepting
all HTML tag names as input.
