# Layout

In Marigold, each theme follows certain principles that concern the structure and the layout of an application.
The following topics give you an overview on how to use Layout Components and the Layout Principles.

## Layout Components

### Box

Set all layout props as you need them from your theme.

```tsx live
<Box bg="disabled" p="small">
    <Text>This is a box (or a container?)</Text>
</Box>
```

### Column, Columns

Column widths need to add up to 12

_children of Column are not below each other...it is just pretty if each Column has only one child and then it's equivalent to Stack_

```tsx live
<Columns>
  <Column width={6}>
    <Badge bg="disabled">This is the</Badge>
    <Badge bg="disabled">Same as </Badge>
    <Badge bg="disabled">Stack</Badge>
    <Badge bg="disabled">if you want</Badge>
  </Column>
  <Column width={3}>
    <Badge bg="disabled">But you can</Badge>
    <Badge bg="disabled">determine the width!</Badge>
    <Badge bg="disabled">here it stacks...</Badge>
    <Badge bg="disabled">because it's too narrow</Badge>
  </Column>
  <Column width={3}>
    <Badge bg="disabled">This is weird</Badge>
  </Column>
</Columns>
```

### Container

The same as `<Box>` but with a fixed width of 100%. Use it if you need the full size of the screen.
Use the `<Container>` to nest elements.

_works better if you just use the `<Box>` for this purpose...._

```tsx live
<Box bg="secondary" p="small">
  <Badge bg="disabled">I am in the container</Badge>
  <Badge bg="disabled">I am in the container</Badge>
</Box>
```

### Stack

Use the `<Stack>` component to stack elements and separate them with a fix spacing. Alter the alignment inside of its parent with the `align` prop.

```tsx live
<div>
<Stack space="small" align="left">
  <Badge bg="disabled">Stack Me</Badge>
  <Badge bg="disabled">If You Can</Badge>
  <Badge bg="disabled">(left)</Badge>
</Stack>
<Divider />
<Stack space="small" align="center">
  <Badge bg="disabled">Stack Me</Badge>
  <Badge bg="disabled">If You Can</Badge>
  <Badge bg="disabled">(center)</Badge>
</Stack>
<Divider />
<Stack space="small" align="right">
  <Badge bg="disabled">Stack Me</Badge>
  <Badge bg="disabled">If You Can</Badge>
  <Badge bg="disabled">(right)</Badge>
</Stack>
</div>
```
