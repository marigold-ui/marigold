## Installation

To install Marigold you can use any common package managers like [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```

**With yarn:**

```

**With pnpm:**

```bash
pnpm add @marigold/components
```

In addition to the components, you usually want to install an existing [theme](/introduction/theming).

<Message messageTitle="Note" variant="info">
  Please note that [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) >= 17.0.0 and
  [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) >= 17.0.0 are peer
  dependencies for `@marigold/components`.

## Tooling

_Marigold_ works with popular build tools, like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/).

If you are using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to build your app, be sure to add [@types/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react) and [@types/react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react-dom) to your project. _Marigold_ is written in TypeScript and Marigold components are published with their type definitions so that you can take advantage of static type checking and IDE autocomplete.

## Bootstrapping

For _Marigold_ to work correctly, you need to wrap your app with the `MarigoldProvider`. This way _Marigold_ components will be able to access styles and SSR will work out of the box.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button, MarigoldProvider } from '@marigold/components';
import theme from '@marigold/theme-b2b';

const App = () => (
  <MarigoldProvider theme={theme}>
    <Button variant="primary" onClick={() => alert('Hey there!')}>
      Hello World
    </Button>
  </MarigoldProvider>
);
```

See the [Provider](../components/provider) and [Button](../components/button) docs for more information about the components used in this example.

## Next Steps

Now that you've bootstrapped your app, you can dive into the documentation for the available components to understand them in detail read about our principles to learn what drove our decision and which contrains come with our approach.
