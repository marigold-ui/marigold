Forms are the backbone of data submission, making their design critical to the user experience. These guidelines ensure every form in your application is consistent, usable, and accessible, covering layout, spacing, and content organization.

For technical implementation details, state management, and validation patterns, refer to our [Form Implementation](/patterns/form-implementation) guide.

## Layout & Structure

The foundation of effective form design lies in thoughtful layout and structure. How you arrange elements on the page, use whitespace, and organize content directly impacts user comprehension and completion rates. A well-structured form creates a clear visual hierarchy and logical flow that guides users through the data entry process efficiently.

### Overall form layout

Forms should be left-aligned to follow natural reading flow and maintain consistency across your application. To ensure optimal readability across all devices, limit form width to a maximum of 800px using the `container` spacing token.

Whitespace plays a crucial role in form usability. It prevents visual clutter, enhances focus, and creates clear separation between sections and fields. Strategic use of whitespace makes forms easier to scan and complete, ultimately improving the user experience. We provide spacing tokens to help you apply consistent spacing throughout your forms.

<GuidelineTiles>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Align form content to the left for better scanning and organization.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a maximum width of 800px (spacing token `container`) for forms to
          ensure readability across devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure sufficient whitespace around and within the form for a clear
          visual hierarchy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Group related fields together to provide more context and make the UI
          easier to scan.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
</GuidelineTiles>

### Available components

We have various components suitable for forms. You can find a detailed guide on the [Form Fields](../../foundations/form-fields) page.

Besides that we have some other components which you may need to build well-structured forms:

- **Layout components**: [`<Stack>`](../../components/layout/stack/) and [`<Inset>`](../../components/layout/inset/) to organize fields and sections.
- **Accordion**: Group fields with an [accordion](../../components/navigation/accordion/) for lengthy forms or optional fields. Use accordions for sections that can be collapsed to save space and reduce cognitive load.
- **Buttons**: Use primary [buttons](../../components/actions/button/) for form submission, secondary for additional actions like "View PDF".
- **Links**: Use [links](../../components/navigation/link/) for navigation to privacy policies or terms of service, not for form actions.
- **Feedback components**: You can use feedback components like [`<SectionMessage>`](../../components/content/section-message/) and [`<Toast>`](../../components/overlay/toast/) to provide additional information or context.

## Content Organization

Forms use three levels of hierarchy to organize content. **Sections** divide the form into distinct topics, **groups** cluster related fields within a section, and **fields** are the individual inputs. Spacing between elements signals how closely they are related. Tighter spacing means a stronger relationship, wider spacing creates visual separation.

### Section

Sections help organize related fields together, making forms easier to scan and understand. They are particularly effective when your form collects different types of data or has more than 6-8 fields.

Use `<Stack space="section">` between sections. Within each section, use a headline followed by its fields in a `<Stack space="regular">`.

<ComponentDemo file="./form-section.demo.tsx" />

#### Accordions as sections

Accordions can replace regular sections to create collapsible groups of fields. This is useful for optional information or advanced settings that don't need to be visible by default. Ensure required fields remain visible and are not hidden within collapsed sections.

<ComponentDemo file="./form-accordion.demo.tsx" />

### Group

Groups are sub-clusters of related fields within a section. Use them when a section contains many fields that benefit from additional visual separation, for example an address block within a personal information section.

To create a group, wrap the fields with `<Inset spaceY="group">` to add vertical spacing that visually separates the group from surrounding fields. Inside the group, use `<Stack space="regular">` to space the fields as usual. The `group` token only controls the separation _around_ the group, not the spacing between fields within it.

<ComponentDemo file="./form-spacing-fields.demo.tsx" />

#### Accordions within sections

Accordions can also be used _within_ a section to group content, allowing users to focus on the most important fields while keeping additional options accessible. The demo above shows both patterns.

### Field

Individual fields are the building blocks of your form. Their arrangement and sizing directly impact how users navigate and complete the form.

<GuidelineTiles>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow a predictable order of fields when creating forms.</li>
        <li>Place required fields before optional ones within each section.</li>
        <li>Position dependent fields immediately after their parent field.</li>
        <li>
          Fields should have a maximum width based on their expected content
          length.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
</GuidelineTiles>

Spacing between fields uses these tokens:

- **`regular`**: Default vertical spacing between fields. Use `<Stack space="regular">` within any section or group.
- **`related`**: For two fields that form a logical unit, such as start/end dates or postcode + city. Use `<Inline space="related">` for horizontal pairs.
- **`tight`**: Connects a headline to its description or a field to a supplementary link. Use when two elements should be perceived as a single unit.

### Required vs. optional fields

These fields must be filled out for the form to be submitted. They are clearly indicated with an asterisk (\*) next to the label. Optional fields do not have this indicator, allowing users to skip them if they choose.

## Actions

Form actions guide users through completion and submission. Every form requires a primary submit action, but many forms benefit from additional secondary actions that provide alternative paths or supplementary functionality.

### Using additional actions in forms

Additional actions can enhance the user experience by providing options like "view PDF", "Reset", or "Save as Draft". These actions should be clearly differentiated from the primary submit action to avoid confusion.

Place the action near the related field where the action is for with that context is given. Links should be placed usually next or below the related field.

<ComponentDemo file="./form-link.demo.tsx" mode="preview" />

### Submit placement

The submit button should be positioned at the bottom of the form, aligned to the left to follow the natural reading flow. Place the primary action first, followed by secondary actions with appropriate spacing.

<ComponentDemo file="./form-action.demo.tsx" mode="preview" />

## Admin- and Mastermark

Some forms may require special fields that are only accessible to users with administrator or master user roles. These fields should be clearly marked and separated from regular fields to avoid confusion.

You can find a complete usage guide on the [Admin- and Mastermark](/patterns/admin-master-mark) page.

Here is a full example of a well-structured form with sections using the guidelines mentioned above. This is a fictional event registration form that includes various field types, sections, and actions.
