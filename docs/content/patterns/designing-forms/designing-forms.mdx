Form design guidelines are essential in a design system to ensure consistency, usability, and accessibility across all user interfaces. When forms follow established patterns, users can navigate and complete them more efficiently while reducing cognitive load. This consistency not only improves the overall user experience but also helps maintain brand coherence and streamlines development workflows.

Forms consist of various inputs and controls for submitting data. These guidelines will help you structure forms consistently throughout your application.

## Basis layout

It is important to consider the overall layout of the form, including the use of white space and the placement of buttons and other elements.
Accessibility best practices should be followed, such as providing clear, descriptive labels and ensuring that form fields are appropriately labeled and structured for screen readers.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Group related fields inside sections to provide more context and make
          the UI easier scannable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a maximum width of 800px for forms to ensure readability across
          devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Align form content to the left for better scanning and organization.
        </li>
        <li>Follow a predictable order of fields when creating forms.</li>
      </ul>
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
</GuidelineTiles>

### Which components can I use?

We have various components suitable for forms. You can find a detailed guide on the [Form Fields](../../foundations/form-fields) page.

Key components for form structure:

- **Layout components**: `<Stack>`, `<Inline>`, and `<Inset>` to organize fields and sections
- **Accordion**: Group fields with expandable sections for lengthy forms or optional fields
- **Buttons**: Use primary buttons for form submission, secondary for additional actions like "View PDF"
- **Links**: For navigation to privacy policies or terms of service, not for form actions

## Sections

Sections help organize related fields together, making forms easier to scan and understand. They provide visual separation and context, allowing users to process information in manageable chunks.

Forms with multiple sections should maintain 56px spacing between sections using `<Stack space={14}>`.

<ComponentDemo file="./form-spacing-sections.demo.tsx" mode="preview" />

### When to use sections

- **Complex forms**: When your form has more than 6-8 fields
- **Different data types**: When collecting different categories of information (e.g., personal info, billing details, preferences)
- **Progressive disclosure**: When some fields are conditional based on previous selections
- **Multi-step processes**: When breaking a long form into smaller, focused steps

## Fields

Fields should have appropriate width based on their expected content length.

      <ul>
        <li>Follow a predictable order of fields when creating forms.</li>
        <li>Place required fields before optional ones within each section.</li>
        <li>Position dependent fields immediately after their parent field.</li>
      </ul>
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
</GuidelineTiles>

### Spacing between fields

- **Vertical spacing**: Use 32px spacing between individual fields within a section. This can be archieved by using the `<Stack>` component with the `space` prop set to `8`.
- **Related fields**: Group closely related fields (like address) with 16px spacing also add extra padding to the Y-axis inside the group. This can be achieved by wrapping the related fields in another `<Stack>` component with the `space` prop set to `4` and adding padding to the Y-axis with a `<Inset>` using the `spaceY` prop set to `4`.

<ComponentDemo file="./form-spacing-fields.demo.tsx" />

### When to group fields

- **Related information**: When fields share a common context or purpose (e.g. address fields, date and time)
- **Conditional fields**: When certain fields are only relevant based on previous answers

### Required vs. optional fields

These fields must be filled out for the form to be submitted. They are clearly indicated with an asterisk (\*) next to the label. Optional fields do not have this indicator, allowing users to skip them if they choose.

When using `<Accordion>` components to group fields, ensure that required fields are placed outside of the accordion to maintain visibility and accessibility.

## Admin- and Mastermark

Some forms may require special fields that are only accessible to users with administrator or master user roles. These fields should be clearly marked and separated from regular fields to avoid confusion.

You can find a complete guide on how to use the admin- and master mark on the [Admin- and Mastermark](/patterns/admin-master-mark) page.

## Actions

Form actions guide users through completion and submission. Every form requires a primary submit action, but many forms benefit from additional secondary actions that provide alternative paths or supplementary functionality.

### Using additional actions in forms

Additional actions can enhance the user experience by providing options like "view PDF", "Reset", or "Save as Draft". These actions should be clearly differentiated from the primary submit action to avoid confusion.

Place the action near the related field where the action is for with that context is given. Links should be placed usually next or below the related field.

<ComponentDemo file="./form-link.demo.tsx" mode="preview" />

### Submit placement

The submit button should be positioned at the bottom of the form, aligned to the left to follow the natural reading flow. Place the primary action first, followed by secondary actions with appropriate spacing.

<ComponentDemo file="./form-action.demo.tsx" mode="preview" />

Here is a full example of a well-structured form with sections using the guidelines mentioned above. This is a fictional event registration form that includes various field types, sections, and actions.
