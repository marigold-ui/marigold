badge: new

The admin- and master mark is a visual pattern used to signal that a setting or function is not available to organizers, but reserved for internal use by developers or Reservix employees. It provides a clear boundary between organizer-facing features and internal tools, helping designers and developers avoid accidental exposure of internal controls in user interfaces.

## Anatomy

- a badge, Placement relative to related element or section of a page
- text is either "Admin" or "Master"
- differentiated by color

(Appearance demo without controls?)

## Usage

- Internal tools visible in shared interfaces
- Developer-only configuration options
- Features in production UIs that are hidden or irrelevant for organizers
- Features that are not yet in production (e.g. because they are only partially implemented or in a testing phase)

- Not a replacement for proper role-based access control
- Not needed in strictly internal tools where no organizer view exists

### Anatomy & Placement

- place next to a the control or section that it belong
- can be a form field or a naviagation element like a tab

(demo with tabs)

### Within a Table

- expection is when rows in a table are only visible internally
- no badge, but background and indicator
