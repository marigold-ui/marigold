The admin- and master mark is a visual pattern used to signal that a setting or function is not available to organizers, but reserved for internal use by developers or Reservix employees. It provides a clear boundary between organizer-facing features and internal tools, helping designers and developers avoid accidental exposure of internal controls in user interfaces.

    The admin- and master mark is intended for use within the Reservix System
    only. It reflects internal role structures and access levels that are
    specific to our platform and should not be used in third-party or
    white-label implementations.
