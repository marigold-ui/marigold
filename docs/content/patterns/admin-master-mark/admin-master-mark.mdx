The admin- and master mark is a visual pattern used to signal that a setting or function is not available to organizers, but reserved for internal use by developers or Reservix employees. It provides a clear boundary between organizer-facing features and internal tools, helping designers and developers avoid accidental exposure of internal controls in user interfaces.
