UI patterns are practical solutions for common design challenges found in different types of interfaces. They work across various scenarios and provide clear guidance on how to combine components to fit specific situations.

By adopting these patterns, designers can save time and effort, focusing instead on customizing and refining solutions to suit their specific needs. These standardized solutions provide a reliable framework for building interfaces that are intuitive and user-friendly, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.
