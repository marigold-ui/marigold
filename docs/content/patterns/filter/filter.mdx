In many applications, large or complex data sets can be difficult to navigate. Filtering helps users focus on what matters most by narrowing results to meet specific criteria or comparing a smaller subset of items. By removing irrelevant results, filtering improves efficiency and makes workflows smoother.

## Anatomy

The filtering pattern in Marigold combines consistent layout with flexible component usage. While the overall structure remains the same, the specific components used can be adapted to the data set and the applicationâ€™s context. This adaptability allows the pattern to support a wide range of use cases while delivering a clear and efficient user experience.

The image below shows the main areas of the pattern, their placement within the layout, and how they work together.

- **Data Set:** The data set is the collection of items to which filters are applied. Items that match the filter criteria are displayed, while others are hidden. This area typically takes up most of the layout because it is the primary focus for the user. Depending on the type of data, it can appear as a [table](/components/collection/table) or as items arranged in [tiles](/components/layout/tiles) and [cards](/components/content/card).
- **Toolbar:** The toolbar is positioned above the data set and may include elements such as a search field, sorting options, and a button to open the filter panel. Placing these controls here gives users quick access to actions that refine results without requiring them to scroll.
- **Applied Filter:** This area lists the filters currently in use, allowing quick review and adjustments. It also offers a single action to clear all filters at once. This gives the user clarity about what is being displayed, prevents confusion, and enables faster refinements.
- **Filter Panel:** The filter controls, for example checkboxes, radio buttons and sliders, are shown in a panel that slides in from the right side of the page. While it overlaps part of the content, it does not block the rest of the page, so other content remains visible and interactive. This approach allows filters to be changed without breaking the flow of work, keeping the process quick and seamless.
- **Pagination:** Located below the data set, the pagination divides the filtered results into smaller, manageable pages. Placing it here keeps navigation controls close to the content they affect, provides a natural reading flow from the data to the controls, and reduces cognitive load, making it easier to browse large data sets.

## Usage

Filters should be used when a data set is large or complex enough that users need to narrow down results to find what they are looking for. They are especially useful when there are multiple parameters or categories that can meaningfully reduce the number of items shown. Applying filters helps users complete tasks more efficiently, avoid information overload, and focus on relevant data.

### Batch filtering

Batch filtering supports the user making multiple selections across different parameters and only updating the results of the data set when the user interacts with a global "apply" function. This method is useful when the data set is very large or when the filter parameters are complex.

### Show Applied filters

### Revert filters

If applying filters to a data set yields no results, offer users an option to clear all or specific filters.

This can be done by adding a "Clear all" action to the Application State or by including dismissible Tags for each applied filter.

TODO: Toolbar (from RAC) for the ... toolbar.
TODO: Collapsable (from RAC Disclosure?) for applied filters (if there are too much)
TODO: "No filter applied" empty state for applied filters
TODO: add a number badge in the sidebar? (or at the filter element, when combined with the applied filters provides a detailed snapshot of what specific filter values are applied to the data set and the relevant parameters that they correspond with)
