In many applications, users often face large or complex data sets that can be overwhelming to navigate. To make sense of this information and get to what matters most, filtering features come into play. They help with tasks such as narrowing results to meet certain criteria or comparing a smaller group of items. By reducing the need to scroll through irrelevant results, filtering makes workflows faster and more efficient.

## Anatomy

The filter pattern brings together components that form a reusable structure, enabling clear and efficient data filtering. While the overall layout remains consistent across implementations, individual component usage is flexible, adapting to the specific data set and the applicationâ€™s needs. This flexibility allows the pattern to fit a wide variety of use cases while still delivering the best possible user experience.

The following image illustrates the main areas of the pattern, showing their placement within the layout and the relationships between them.

### Data set

_Data set_ is the collection of items to which filters are applied. Items matching the filter parameters are displayed, while others are hidden. This area usually takes up most of the layout because it is the most relevant for the user. Depending on the data, it may appear as a [table](/components/collection/table) or as items arranged in [tiles](/components/layout/tiles) of [cards](/components/content/card).

### Toolbar

The _toolbar_ is an area positioned above the data set. It can contain elements such as a search field, an option to sort the items, and a button to open the full filter panel. This placement provides users with immediate tools to refine results without scrolling, keeping high-priority actions within easy reach.

**Filter panel:** Interactive controls, contained within a non-modal overlay, that allow users to set parameters or choose values to narrow down which items from the data set are displayed. This approach keeps the filtering options accessible without blocking interaction with the rest of the page, enabling quicker adjustments and a smoother workflow.

**Applied filters:** A visible list or summary of the currently active filter selections, enabling users to quickly review and adjust the filtering criteria. This helps maintain clarity about what is being shown, reduces the chance of confusion, and allows for faster modifications to refine results.

**Pagination:** A way to split the filtered data set into smaller, easier-to-browse pages, improving performance and making navigation through large data sets more manageable.

## Maaaany filters (Simple vs complex)

- required?
- inline bar vs page sidebar vs inline sidebar ?
- inline bar only when you have simple filters at most 5?

## Usage

Batch filtering supports the user making multiple selections across different parameters and only updating the results of the data set when the user interacts with a global "apply" function. This method is useful when the data set is very large or when the filter parameters are complex.

### Show Applied filters

- add a number badge in the sidebar? (or at the filter element)
- This, when combined with the applied filters provides a detailed snapshot of what specific filter values are applied to the data set and the relevant parameters that they correspond with.

### Revert filters

If applying filters to a data set yields no results, offer users an option to clear all or specific filters.

This can be done by adding a "Clear all" action to the Application State or by including dismissible Tags for each applied filter.

TODO: Toolbar (from RAC)
TODO: Collapsable (from RAC Disclosure?)
TODO: "No filter applied" empty state for applied filters
