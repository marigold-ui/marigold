Messages are feedback mechanisms that inform users about important events, actions, conditions, or information within the application.

Appropriate communication of system status is critical to building trust with users, and is Jakob Nielsen’s [first usability heuristic for user interface design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/#toc-1-visibility-of-system-status-1). Too many messages, however, can dilute their usefulness and lead to alert fatigue. Therefore, it’s important to know exactly when and how to use them.

## Key principles

Messages should be:

- **Relevant.** Messages should only be sent when the information significantly impacts the user’s overall experience or current task.
- **Timely.** Messages should be shown at the moment they’re needed and dismissed once they’re no longer relevant.
- **Actionable.** Messages should always indicate the way forward, including links or other actions when helpful.
- **Concise.** Messages should express the most essential information in the fewest words possible.

## When to use

Use messages to provide timely and important updates about events, actions, conditions or information that impact a user’s experience or their successful task completion. Messages can be either task-generated or system-generated.

### Task-generated messages

Task-generated messages respond to specific user actions during a specific task. They provide immediate feedback about the effects of a user’s action.

For example, you may want to send a task-generated message when:

- A change was successfully saved
- A file couldn’t be opened
- The user is approaching the maximum number of items they can add to a dataset

### System-generated messages

System-generated messages communicate relevant updates about system status that aren’t triggered by a user’s current task, but may impact their experience or require their attention.

You might send a system-generated message when:

- Scheduled maintenance will impact system performance for a period of time
- The user’s account will be suspended unless a new payment method is added
- Connection with the server has been lost

## When not to use

Don’t use messages when the information does not have a significant impact on the user’s current task or overall experience, or when the same information can be communicated in a less obtrusive way. For example:

- To draw attention to a new element or piece of content, you can use a [badge](/components/content/badge).
- To draw attention to the status of just one UI element, you can use an [icon](/concepts/icon) with a [tooltip](/components/overlay/tooltip) for short, non-essential supporting information. (Tooltips have lower accessibility and usability across device types than messages, so do not use them for critical information.)
- Messages that describe permanent, non-resolvable aspects or features of a page may be better communicated through headings, description text, or information architecture.

## Message statuses

- **Informational**: Provides relevant information about the system’s features or content that could be worth knowing to the user.
- **Success**: Confirms that an action was successful.
- **Warning**: Alerts users to significant issues or changes that may require attention.
- **Error**: Notifies users of failure states that require immediate action, or that will impede their progress until resolved.

## Message components

------mesage-------

Marigold currently includes three different components for offering feedback messages: Dialogs, section messages and [input field validation](/concepts/validation).

### Dialog

A [dialog](/components/overlay/dialog) is an overlay component that can be used to convey messages to users. Dialogs should only be used to convey messages in high-urgency situations, where the user’s failure to heed the message could have strongly negative results. These dialogs typically take the form of a confirmation dialog, which ask for confirmation that a taken action was intended by the user. In this case, user interaction is required to proceed.

Interruption level: High
Persistence: Permanent
Dismissable: Yes (optional)
Position: Overlaid on the interface, typically in the center of the viewport

### Permanent dismissal

Confirmation dialogs also carry the optional feature of permanent dismissal, that is, a checkbox can be added to ensure the message is never shown again. This can be useful in cases where the user is certain they want to take a potentially dangerous action and is confident they will not need the message again in the future. Use this cautiously.
