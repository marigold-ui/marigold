On this page, you'll discover detailed specifications for design tokens â€” the foundational elements that unify the visual language of your brand or products. Explore how design tokens are constructed and find information on where each token is applied within the design ecosystem.

Tokens are categorized based on Figma's naming conventions, like color and number variables or effects, facilitating seamless integration and efficient design workflows.

## Naming Convention

Knowing how to read token names helps you find the right token quickly in both designs and code.

// TODO make a image with an example
`[property].[intent].[modifier]` (text.base.disabled, bg.surface.overlay)

The name of a design token describes how it should be used, with each part indicating a specific aspect of its usage. Our tokens consist of the following parts:

1. **Property:** The UI element the token should be applied to, like a background, text or border.
2. **Intent:** Identifies different use cases for a token. For example, to indicate user feedback or visual hierachy.
3. **Modifier:** Additional details about the token's purpose. In most cases, this is an interaction state, but it can also indicate where, contextually, the token should be applied (e.g. "raised" in the surface tokens). The `DEFAULT` modifier can be omitted.

## Color Tokens

Color tokens leverage the color palettes from our design system. They provide a systematic approach to managing and applying colors consistently across various elements, while ensuring a cohesive and harmonious visual identity.

### Text Tokens

Text tokens are used to apply specific colors to text, equivalent to the `color` CSS rule or the [`text-{color}` utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/text-color) in TailwindCSS.

#### Intents

Below, you'll find all the available intents for the text tokens:

- **base:** Default values for a specific category of tokens, serving as the foundational colors.
- **inverted:** Alternative default values used when the base color lacks sufficient contrast ratio, ensuring accessibility.
- **brand:** Represents the primary brand color of the company, establishing a consistent visual identity.
- **accent:** Signifies the accent brand color, adding emphasis and vibrancy to the overall design.
- **info:** Represents a feedback color conveying auxiliary information, providing additional context.
- **success:** Serves as a feedback color to indicate successful actions or positive outcomes.
- **warning:** Functions as a feedback color, drawing attention to situations where user intervention is required.
- **error:** Functions as a feedback color in situations of errors or destructive actions, signaling potential issues.

#### Modifier

Furthermore, the following modifier can be applied to all the aforementioned intents:

- **DEFAULT:** Default color for text
- **hover:** Color when text is hovered with a mouse

When selecting "base" or "inverted" as the intent, an additional modifier is available:

- **disabled:** Color when text is used in a disabled control or field.

### Background Tokens

Background tokens are used to apply specific colors to the background of an element. They are equivalent to the `background-color` CSS rule or the [`bg-{color}` utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-color) in TailwindCSS.

#### Intents

Background tokens incorporate the same intents as text tokens (base, inverted, brand, accent, info, success, warning, error). Furthermore, there are the following intents:

- **selected:** Indicates that a specific item from a list or option is chosen.
- **surface:** Functions as the background for a particular surface level.
