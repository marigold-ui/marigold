## Definitions

- **UI Components**: Components that provide specific functionality and user interactions. They are responsible for displaying and interacting with data and user input.
- **Layout Components**: Components that are only concerned with arranging their children in a certain way. They can be composed to create more complex layouts.

## Coding

### Naming

Try to use names from [Open UI](https://open-ui.org/) for components and their props.

### File Structure

- Always use named export and not export default for everything (better debugging experience).
- Use interface to specify component props.
- Use a [barrel file](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/main-1/barrel) to define public components and functions.
- Every component has its own folder (named after it). The folder contains
  - the barrel file (`index.ts`),
  - the implementation of the component (`<component name>.tsx`),
  - the story file (`<component name>.stories.tsx`),
  - the test file (`<component name>.test.tsx`),
  - helpers and child components (`<child component name>.tsx`, `Context.tsx`, …).
- general helper functions are in `@marigold/system` (e.g., `useTheme`).

Here is an example of our file structure:

```
components
└── src
    ├── Button
    │   ├── Button.tsx
    │   ├── Button.test.tsx
    │   ├── Button.stories.tsx
    │   └── index.ts
    ├── Menu
    │   ├── ActionMenu.tsx
    │   ├── Context.ts
    │   ├── index.ts
    │   ├── Menu.stories.tsx
    │   ├── Menu.test.tsx
    │   ├── Menu.tsx
    │   ├── MenuItem.tsx
    │   ├── MenuSection.tsx
    │   └── MenuTrigger.tsx
    └── index.ts
```

### Writing Tests

- Use `@testing-library/user-event` for testing user interactions.
- Use `@testing-library/react` for testing hooks.
- Use the `setup` helper from our test-utils to apply theming.
- Test if styles are applied correctly, including variants and sizes. Write a theme to use within the test file.
- At minimal, test interactions that are relevant for our use cases.
- Additional features (not included in `react-aria(-components)` need to be tested.
- Use `toHaveClass` to if you want to test if a certain style needs to be applied, otherwise use `toMatchInlineSnapshot` to test the `className` instead.

Example of how we write tests:

```tsx
test('accepts a variant with parts and an icon and support grid areas', () => {
  render(
    <SectionMessage data-testid="messages" variant="warning">
      <SectionMessage.Title>info</SectionMessage.Title>
      <SectionMessage.Content>Danger</SectionMessage.Content>
    </SectionMessage>
  );
  const container = screen.getByTestId('messages');
  const title = screen.getByText('info');
  const content = screen.getByText('Danger');
  // eslint-disable-next-line testing-library/no-node-access
  const icon = container.firstChild;

  expect(container.className).toMatchInlineSnapshot(
    `"grid auto-rows-min text-orange-700"`
  );
  expect(content.className).toMatchInlineSnapshot(
    `"[grid-area:content] items-end"`
  );
  expect(title.className).toMatchInlineSnapshot(
    `"[grid-area:title] font-bold"`
  );

  expect(icon).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Writing Stories

- Show the most basic use case (using the defaults for all props).
- Add as much known use cases from our other applications as possible.
- Add some more complex use cases showing the features of the component.
- Expose available props as `meta.argTypes`.
- Available properties should be as specific as possible (e.g. `variant` should not be a string, but rather [a list of available variants](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls)).
- By default the Story component will be rendered within the `<FieldGroup labelWidth="200px">` component. Sometimes e.g. `Table.stories.tsx` the `labelWidth` breaks the components in core theme, thats why the parameter `disableLabelWidth` was created. You can use this parameter in the stories meta data to avoid applying the `<FieldGroup>` (the same goes for demos, there you have to write is as property from the `ComponentDemo`).

[Link to latest Storybook](https://marigold-latest.vercel.app/)

Example of how we write stories:

```tsx
const meta = {
  title: 'Components/Message',
  component: Message,
  argTypes: {
    variant: {
      control: {
        type: 'radio',
      },
      options: ['info', 'warning', 'error'],
      description: 'The variants of the message',
    },
  },
} satisfies Meta<typeof Message>;

export default meta;
type Story = StoryObj<typeof meta>;

export const Basic: Story = {
  render: args => (
    <SectionMessage {...args}>
      <SectionMessage.Title>Hint</SectionMessage.Title>
      <SectionMessage.Content>
        <Text>Hello, I am a simple message.</Text>
      </SectionMessage.Content>
    </SectionMessage>
  ),
};
```

## API

### Component Naming Convention

[Compound components](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/08/compound-components-react/) should use dot-notion to imply their relationship and hiearchy (e.g. `<Tabs>` and `<Tabs.Item>`)

```tsx
<Tabs>
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Item id="1">Start</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item id="2">Settings</Tabs.Item>
    <Tabs.Item id="3">More</Tabs.Item>
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.TabPanel id="1">Start</Tabs.TabPanel>
  <Tabs.TabPanel id="2">Settings</Tabs.TabPanel>
  <Tabs.TabPanel id="3">More</Tabs.TabPanel>
</Tabs>
```

If we use `react-aria-components` for a certain component, we name the component we build `_Component` and import the RAC component as it is `import { Component } from 'react-aria-components'`

We export the component without the `_` e.g. `export { _Component as Component}`

### Props Naming Convention

Component props should always use the regular HTML attribute name (`disabled` and not `isDisabled`).

Props that are event handlers props should start with `on` (e.g., `onSelectionChange`, `onChange`, ...).

Props should have a given description, because these are used by our props table in the documentation.

Props that we need to import because of react-aria-components should be imported as followed:

```tsx
import type RAC from 'react-aria-components';

export interface ComponentProps extends RAC.ColumnProps {}
```

### The `onChange` method

We have a slight different naming of some `onChange` functions. This can cause confusion when using it. We have react arias `onInputChange` method which we use for our `Combobox` and `AutoComplete` as `onChange`.

Than we have react arias `onSelectionChange` which is used to handle the selection of an input. We use this in `ComboBox`, the same in `Autocomplete` but there we map it internally on `onSubmit`.

`Select` is a special case because we just have one on change handler, thats why we currently have `onSelectionChange` as `onChange` there.

## Styling

### Exposing className on UI Components

We don’t expose the `className` prop on any of our components. The reasons for this are as followed:

- prevent entropy in designs
- prevent developers and designer from accidentally using styles not part of the design system

We write a type for the props that we don’t want to expose like this:

```tsx
type RemovedProps = 'className';

export interface ComponentProps extends Omit<RAC.ComponentProp, RemovedProps> {}
```

<Callout title="Escape hatch">
Use a regular `<div>` (or any other HTML element) and add available classes from our theme.
</Callout>

### A UI Component must be themable

UI Components can be either components that consist of only one element (e.g., `<Button>`), which require styling through class names, or slot components (e.g., `<TextField>`), which offer the ability to style specific parts of the component.

In the case of slot components like `<TextField>`, various slots such as the container, label, and input field can be individually styled within the theme. This allows you to apply distinct styles to each part by using the corresponding slot.

![Themable Component](/themable-component.png)

- Every visible part of a component hast to accept a `className`, which can be used to set the styling of the element.
- Every component can have default `className` values. They can be overriden by a theme.
- There maybe parts of a component that are only there because of the implementation or a11y reasons. Their `className` can be hardcoded if necessary. (Example: Hidden `<input type="checkbox">` inside the `<Checkbox>` component for a11y).
- If the component has more than one part, the outermost slot ist called `container`.

- The value of every `className` can be defined within a theme. It will override the default `className` values, if there are any.
- The styles of a component, consisting of only one part, can be accessed in a theme at the following path: `components.<name of the Component>` (component names are PascalCased)
- If a component consist of mulitple parts, its styles can be accessed in a theme at the following path: `components.<name of the Component>.{ [slot in SlotName]: Styles }` (component names are PascalCased)

This codeblock show how to apply `classNames` on the `<Input>` component which has diffrent slots. It can be styled through theme with certain slots: icon, action and input.

```tsx
<div
  className="group/input relative flex items-center"
  data-icon={icon && ''}
  data-action={action && ''}
>
  {inputIcon}
  <input
    {...props}
    className={cn(
      'flex-1',
      'disabled:cursor-not-allowed',
      '[&[type=file]]:border-none [&[type=file]]:p-0',
      '[&[type=color]]:ml-0 [&[type=color]]:border-none [&[type=color]]:bg-transparent [&[type=color]]:p-0',
      classNames.input
    )}
    ref={ref}
    type={type}
  />
  {inputAction}
</div>
```

- Use [Tailwinds group modifier](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#styling-based-on-parent-state) to style children based on a parent state.
- Use the selector from `tailwindcss-react-aria-components` to style a component based on its state.

This is how a style file with slots look like.

```tsx
const Input: ThemeComponent<'Input'> = {
  icon: cva({ base: 'left-2' }),
  action: cva({ base: 'right-0' }),
  input: cva({
    base: [
      'leading-2',
      'read-only:focus:border-border-light read-only:focus:outline-hidden',
    ],
  }),
};
```

To prevent overwriting base styles through variants and sizes we should add `default` values for the styles. Behind the `cva` statement are the styles that are always applied, in this example text color (which is applied for all variants). But sometimes we need only a default, that is not on all styles. In the end only necessary and common classes should be in the base styles.

```tsx
export const Select: ThemeComponent<'Select'> = {
  icon: cva({
    base: 'text-secondary-400',
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: '',
        floating: 'justify-self-end',
      },
      size: {
        default: '',
        small: 'size-3',
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: 'default',
      size: 'default',
    },
  }),
};
```

### Structure of Color Design Tokens

- [Color design tokens](../foundations/design-tokens) need to have a semantic name that reflects their use case. (e.g., `bg-disabled` for disabled backgrounds)
- Every color token needs to have a description when and where to use it.
- Prevent using the color pallete directly (e.g., instead of using `bg-red-700` use `bg-error`)

Example of structures for surface colors:

```tsx
  surface: {
    /**
    * Use this for base layer.
    */
    DEFAULT: white,
    /**
    * Use this for e.g. card backgrounds.
    */
    raised: white,
    /**
    * Use this for e.g. popovers.
    */
    overlay: white,
    /**
    * Use this for lowered elements.
    */
    sunken: gray[100],
  }
```

### Usage and Structure of Style Props

- [Style props](../foundations/style-props) are using tokens from TailwindCSS by default.
- Every layout component should have style props to make its layout adatable.
- UI Components should have style props when there it is possible to configure properties related to layouting the component (e.g., text alignment, spacing, …).
- Values of the style props have to correspond to a scale in TailwindCSS (e.g., `width={full}` will be translated to the class `w-full` ).

Example of how we use style-props from TailwindCSS

```tsx
const width = {
  full: 'w-full',
  auto: 'w-auto',
  px: 'w-px',
  0: 'w-0',
  '0.5': 'w-0.5',
  1: 'w-1',
  '1.5': 'w-1.5',
  2: 'w-2',
  '2.5': 'w-2.5',
  3: 'w-3',
  '3.5': 'w-3.5',
  4: 'w-4',
  5: 'w-5',
  6: 'w-6',
  7: 'w-7',
  8: 'w-8',
  9: 'w-9',
  10: 'w-10',
  11: 'w-11',
  12: 'w-12',
  14: 'w-14',
  16: 'w-16',
  20: 'w-20',
  24: 'w-24',
  28: 'w-28',
  32: 'w-32',
  36: 'w-36',
  40: 'w-40',
  44: 'w-44',
  48: 'w-48',
  52: 'w-52',
  56: 'w-56',
  60: 'w-60',
  64: 'w-64',
  72: 'w-72',
  80: 'w-80',
  96: 'w-96',
};
```

```tsx
<TextField label="My Label" width={40} />
```
