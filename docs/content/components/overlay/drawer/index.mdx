The `<Drawer>` component is a flexible UI element used to present additional content is a side-in panel, typically from the edge of the screen. Unlike dialogs, it doesn't block interaction with the rest of the page, making it ideal for non-modal interactions.

Key features of the `<Drawer>` component include customizable placemnt, adjustable sizes and abilitly to remain non-modal for uninterrupted page interaction.

## Anatomy

A `<Drawer>` consists of an optinal title, content, actions. The title provides context for the user, while the content holds the main message or interactive elements like forms. The actions section contains controls such as buttons for confirming or cancelling.

### Secondary information

When users want more detail about an item without leaving the current view, a drawer is ideal. For instance, clicking on a ticket, order, or user could open a drawer with extended information and actions.

### Contextual utilities

Drawers can provide utilities like quick help, a chat panel, or notes. These stay “on the side” and don’t interfere with the main content area.

### Filter

A common use case for drawers is displaying filter panels. Drawers provide a non-intrusive way to expose filtering options while keeping the main content visible and interactive. This allows users to adjust filters, apply changes, and immediately see updated results without leaving the page, for more information about the filter you can visit [Filter pattern](/patterns/filter).

### Placement

The `<Drawer>` can be placed on any edge of the screen using `placement` prop,, placement should relfect the type of content and user's workflow:

- **right(most common)**: details, contextual utilities.
- **left**: navigaiton, or menus that help users to swich between different views.
- **top**: lightweight global actions like notifications, announcements, or system alerts. Best for transient information that needs quick visibility but not long interaction.
- **bottom**: short confirmation actions, quick reply forms, or pickers. Ideal for focused tasks that don’t require leaving the current screen.
