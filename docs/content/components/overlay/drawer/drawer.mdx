      <li>allowing users to adjust settings or view details without leaving the page,</li>
      <li>keeping the main workflow uninterrupted,</li>
      <li>presenting secondary or supporting content.</li>
    </ul>

### Filter

A common use case for drawers is displaying filter panels. Drawers provide a non-intrusive way to expose filtering options while keeping the main content visible and interactive. This allows users to adjust filters, apply changes, and immediately see updated results without leaving the page.

### Placemnt

The `<Drawer>` can be placed on any edge of the screen using `placement` prop.

<ComponentDemo file="./drawer-placement.demo.tsx" />
### Dismissal

While drawer component is open, users can still interact with the rest of the page. To accomodate both mouse and keyboard users, the `<Drawer>` provide multiple ways to close it:

- clicking the same trigger button again will close the drawer,
- pressing the `Esc` key will also close the drawer.

  <ComponentDemo file="./drawer-dismissal.demo.tsx" />

### Controlled

You can programatically open a drawer by using the `open` and `onOpenChange` props from the `<Drawer.Trigger>` This is particulary helpful when the action can't be initiated by simple `<Button>` component.
