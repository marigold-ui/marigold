The `<Menu>` component allows you to define a menu element. It's useful when you want a list with options or actions.

It is structured in three parts: `<Menu.Trigger>`, `<Menu>` and `<Menu.Item>`. And there is a simple `<Button>` necessary for handling the menu trigger.

If you want create a variant, you can style different parts of the `<Menu>` separate, there is the `container` part and the `item`.

There is also a companion component called `<ActionMenu>` which you can use if you want to take some actions. You can have a look on how it works in the examples. It works quiet similar to the normal `<Menu>` component. All you have to add are the `<Menu.Item>`s.

## Usage

### Import

To import the component you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@marigold/components';
```

### Apperance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

### Props

<PropsTable
  props={[
    {
      property: 'onAction',
      type: '(key: Key) => void',
      description: 'Handler that should call an action.',
      default: 'none',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Trigger props

<PropsTable
  props={[
    {
      property: 'disabled',
      type: 'boolean',
      description: 'Disables the complete menu.',
      default: 'false',
    },
    {
      property: 'open',
      type: 'boolean',
      description: 'Set the open state of the menu.',
      default: 'false',
    },
    {
      property: 'onOpenChange',
      type: '() => void',
      description:
        "Handler that is called when the overlay's open state changes.",
      default: 'none',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Examples

### Simple Menu with Action

In this example you can see a simple `<Menu>` with some items to select. After selection an action can be applied.

<ComponentDemo file="./menu-action.demo.tsx" />

### Menu with Sections

To group related MenuItems, you can use `<Menu.Section>` and pass `title` for the group name.

<ComponentDemo file="./menu-section.demo.tsx" />

### Disabled Menu

In this example the `<Menu.Trigger>` has set its prop `disabled`. So you can't interact with the `<Menu>` anymore.

<ComponentDemo file="./menu-disabled.demo.tsx" />

### ActionMenu

In this example, an `Icon` has been inserted into the `Button` to serve as a kebab menu.
As shown here, any type of icon can be used within the menu and there are no restrictions.
It is very similar to the normal `<Menu>` component.

<ComponentDemo file="./kebab-menu.demo.tsx" />

### Menu with onOpenChange property

Here you can see how the properties `open` and `onOpenChange` are used together with a `<Button>`. A function handles the state for the menu. You just can open the `<Menu>` with the external `<Button>` component, not with the menu button.
A common use Case is also to open the `<Menu>` with the keyboard.

<ComponentDemo file="./menu-open.demo.tsx" />

### Menu item opens Dialog

This Example shows how to open a [`<Dialog>`](/components/dialog/) from a `<Menu.Item>`.
For that you have not to use a `<Dialog.Trigger>`, instead use our `<Dialog.Controller>`. With that you don't have to use a `<Button>` to trigger the dialog.

<ComponentDemo file="./menu-open-dialog.demo.tsx" />
