The `<Menu>` component allows you to define a menu element. It's useful when you want a list with options or actions.

It is structured in two parts `<Menu>` and `<Menu.Item>`. The `<Menu>` contains the trigger and the button per default. You also can use the `<Menu.Section>` which you can use to separate the menu items from each other.

There is also a companion component called `<ActionMenu>` which you can use if you want to take some actions. You can have a look on how it works in the examples. It works quiet similar to the normal `<Menu>` component. All you have to add are the `<Menu.Item>`s.

## Usage

In general, Menus are used to hide less frequently used or advanced options until users specifically need them. This keeps the interface clean and focused on essential elements.

Menus are ideal for interactive UI elements, it is distincit from `<Select>`, which is meant for form inputs and value selection.

Menus can speed up interactions for advanced users who are already familiar with the application. These users often rely on shortcuts and context-specific actions to work more efficiently.

### Simple Menu with Action

In this example you can see a simple `<Menu>` with some items to select. it is used when you need a to provide users with a set of of options that will result in a specific action being performed.

<ComponentDemo file="./menu-action.demo.tsx" />

### Menu with Sections

When you have mutliple menu items that can be categorized under different headings. This is particularly useful in complext menus with many options, you can use `<Menu.Section>` and pass `title` for the group name.

<ComponentDemo file="./menu-section.demo.tsx" />

### Disabled Menu Items

In this example the `<Menu>` has set its prop `disabeldKeys`. So you can't interact with the `<Menu.Item>` anymore. Keep in mind, that you have to set an id to the `<Menu.Item>`.

<ComponentDemo file="./menu-disabled.demo.tsx" />

### ActionMenu

The `<ActionMenu>` is typically used to provide quick, context-specific actions related to an item or interface element. It is particularly useful in scenarios where speed and efficiency in selecting an action are crucial.

In this example, the `<ActionMenu>` is used within a table to allow users to perform actions like viewing details of a ticket or deleting a ticket. When "View Details" is selected, a dialog displays key information about the selected ticket, including its ID, event name, and status. The "Delete" option removes the ticket from the list.

The example shows that the `<ActionMenu>` is very similar to the standard `<Menu>` component, offering flexibility and ease of use in various contexts.

<ComponentDemo file="./menu-action-table.demo.tsx" />

### Menu with `onOpenChange` property

Here you can see how the properties `open` and `onOpenChange` are used together with a `<Button>`. A function handles the state for the menu. You just can open the `<Menu>` with the external `<Button>` component, not with the menu button.
A common use Case is also to open the `<Menu>` with the keyboard.

<ComponentDemo file="./menu-open.demo.tsx" />

### Menu item opens Dialog

This Example shows how to open a [`<Dialog>`](/components/dialog/) from a `<Menu.Item>`. It is useful when a menu action requires additional user input or confirmation. Selecting the item opens a `Dialog` where users can provide the necessary information or confirm their choice, making the interaction smooth and efficient.

<ComponentDemo file="./menu-open-dialog.demo.tsx" />

### Menu selection mode

Use `multiple` selection mode when you want to allow users to select multiple options at once, providing flexibility in situations where multiple choices are valid and necessary.

Here you can see how the `selectionMode` from `<Menu>` works. In this example the `selectionMode` is set to `multiple`. If you open the items you can see a selected item.

<ComponentDemo file="./menu-selection.demo.tsx" />
