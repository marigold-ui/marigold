The `<Dialog>` is an overlay component. This means it displays a modal as a reaction to an event. It appears in the middle of the display and blurs out the underlay.

This component can be styled in different parts. It has parts like closeButton and container, which is the component itself, and these parts can be styled separately.

Additionally, the `<Dialog>` is composed of other flexible parts: `<Dialog.Title>`, `<Dialog.Content>`, `<Dialog.Action>`, and `<Dialog.Footer`. The `<Dialog.Content>` holds the primary content or message, while the `<Dialog.Action>` defines interactive buttons for user decisions. `<Dialog.Footer>` can be used to place additional information , ensuring clear separation and organization within the dialog.

A special feature is that you can also pass props to the `<Dialog.Trigger>` and on the `<Dialog>` itself. The closeButton is an optional property that allows you to close the `<Dialog>`.

The `<Dialog>` can also be controlled programmatically, for example, when used within a `<Menu>`.

## Import

import { Dialog } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Appearance

## Props

## Examples

### Form Dialog

The example shows how to use a `<Dialog>` in a simple form context. You can see the `closeButton` is not present by default, you have to click on the buttons or on the underlay to exit the dialog.

<ComponentDemo file="./dialog-form.demo.tsx" />

### Dismiss Dialog

If you choose to add `dismissable={false}` to your `<Dialog.Trigger>`, you can't exit the dialog with clicking on the underlay. Notice to add a action button or the `closeButton` property to the `<Dialog>` as shown in the example, without that you can't click out of the dialog. You just have the possibility to use the escape key on your keyboard. But that's also a property you can set to false.

<ComponentDemo file="./dialog-dismiss.demo.tsx" />

### Dialog opend from Menu

This Example shows how to open a [`<Dialog>`](/components/dialog/) from a `<Menu.Item>`.
For that you have to use a `<Dialog.Trigger>`, but without that you don't have to use a `<Button>` to trigger the dialog, you can write it directly.

<ComponentDemo file="./menu-open-dialog.demo.tsx" />
