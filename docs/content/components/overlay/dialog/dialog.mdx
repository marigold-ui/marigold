The `<Dialog>` is a overlay component. This means it displays a modal as a reaction to an event. It appears in the middle of the display and blurs out the underlay.

This component can be styled in different parts. It has as parts `closeButton` and `container`, which is the component itself, and these parts can be styled separately.

A special thing is also that you can have props on the `<Dialog.Trigger>` and on the `<Dialog>` itself. The `closeButton` is an optionally property with which you can close the `<Dialog>`.

The `<Dialog>` can also be used if you want to controll it for example within a `<Menu>`.

## Examples

### Form Dialog

The example shows how to use a `<Dialog>` in a simple form context. You can see the `closeButton` is not present by default, you have to click on the buttons or on the underlay to exit the dialog.

<ComponentDemo file="./dialog-form.demo.tsx" />

### Dismiss Dialog

If you choose to add `dismissable={false}` to your `<Dialog.Trigger>`, you can't exit the dialog with clicking on the underlay. Notice to add a action button or the `closeButton` property to the `<Dialog>` as shown in the example, without that you can't click out of the dialog. You just have the possibility to use the escape key on your keyboard. But that's also a property you can set to false.

<ComponentDemo file="./dialog-dismiss.demo.tsx" />

### Dialog opend from Menu

This Example shows how to open a [`<Dialog>`](/components/dialog/) from a `<Menu.Item>`.
For that you have to use a `<Dialog.Trigger>`, but without that you don't have to use a `<Button>` to trigger the dialog, you can write it directly.

<ComponentDemo file="./menu-open-dialog.demo.tsx" />
