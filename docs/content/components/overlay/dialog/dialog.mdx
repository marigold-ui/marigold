The `<Dialog>` component is a versatile UI element used to display important content that requires user interaction, typically in a modal or popup window. It is designed to temporarily interrupt the user's workflow to present critical information, request confirmation, or facilitate a task without navigating away from the current page.

Key features of the `<Dialog>` component include customizable content, support for multiple dialog sizes, focus trapping for accessibility, and optional overlay to dim the background. It can be used for alerts, forms, confirmations, or any interactive modal interface.

## Anatomy

TODO

## Appearance

<AppearanceDemo component={title} />

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Usage

### Form Dialog

The example shows how to use a `<Dialog>` in a simple form context. You can see the `closeButton` is not present by default, you have to click on the buttons or on the underlay to exit the dialog.

<ComponentDemo file="./dialog-form.demo.tsx" />

### Dismiss Dialog

If you choose to add `dismissable={false}` to your `<Dialog.Trigger>`, you can't exit the dialog with clicking on the underlay. Notice to add a action button or the `closeButton` property to the `<Dialog>` as shown in the example, without that you can't click out of the dialog. You just have the possibility to use the escape key on your keyboard. But that's also a property you can set to false.

<ComponentDemo file="./dialog-dismiss.demo.tsx" />

### Dialog opend from Menu

This Example shows how to open a [`<Dialog>`](/components/dialog/) from a `<Menu.Item>`.
For that you have to use a `<Dialog.Trigger>`, but without that you don't have to use a `<Button>` to trigger the dialog, you can write it directly.

<ComponentDemo file="./menu-open-dialog.demo.tsx" />
