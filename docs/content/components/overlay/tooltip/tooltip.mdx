The `<Tooltip>` components allows to provide additional information to that user. For that the `<Tooltip>` is divided into a `<Tooltip.Trigger>` and the `<Tooltip>` itself. You need to wrap the trigger around the `<Tooltip>` and a simple button, which is necessary for handle actions.

You should use the `<Tooltip>` if you want to show helpful, short information to the user.

## Usage

When using tooltips, it's essential to strike the right balance. While tooltips can provide valuable information or guidance, overloading a page with too many can confuse or overwhelm users. Focus on placing tooltips only on elements where users commonly struggle or need extra help. Limiting the number of tooltips (2-4 at most per page) ensures they remain effective and don't detract from the overall user experience.

<GuidelineTiles>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Keep the content concise by aiming for 2-4 key points per page.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      Don't use too many tooltips on a page because it can overwhelm the users.

### Tooltip with custom placement

Tooltips can appear above, below, and to each side of the UI element depending on screen real estate and intent.

In this example the placement of the `<Tooltip>` is set to the right. By default it is set to the top. If there isn't enough space for the placement it moves to the bottom.

### Simple and informative Tooltip

Tooltips should provide clear, concise information without including interactive elements. Focus on delivering helpful content that enhances the user experience without requiring additional actions from the user. Simplicity is key to ensuring that tooltips serve their purpose effectively.

### Tooltip only shows when focused

You can use the property `trigger` to the `<Tooltip.Trigger>` and setting it to `focus`. With that you can't hover it anymore, you have to tab in with the keyboard.

### Controlled Tooltip

The open state of the tooltip can be controlled via the `open` and `onOpenChange` props.
