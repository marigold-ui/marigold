The `<Tooltip>` components allows to provide additional information to that user. For that the `<Tooltip>` is divided into a `<Tooltip.Trigger>` and the `<Tooltip>` itself. You need to wrap the trigger around the `<Tooltip>` and a simple button, which is necessary for handle actions.

You should use the `<Tooltip>` if you want to show helpful, short information to the user.

## Usage

### Tooltip with custom placement

In this example the placement of the `<Tooltip>` is set to the right. By default it is set to the top. If there isn't enough space for the placement it moves to the bottom.

<ComponentDemo file="./tooltip-custom.demo.tsx" />

### Tooltip only shows when focused

You can use the property `trigger` to the `<Tooltip.Trigger>` and setting it to `focus`. With that you can't hover it anymore, you have to tab in with the keyboard.

<ComponentDemo file="./tooltip-focus.demo.tsx" />

### Controlled Tooltip

The open state of the tooltip can be controlled via the `open` and `onOpenChange` props.

<ComponentDemo file="./tooltip-pressed.demo.tsx" />
