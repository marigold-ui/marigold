The `<Tooltip>` components allows to provide additional information to that user. For that the `<Tooltip>` is divided into a `<Tooltip.Trigger>` and the `<Tooltip>` itself. You need to wrap the trigger around the `<Tooltip>` and a simple button, which is necessary for handle actions.

You should use the `<Tooltip>` if you want to show helpful, short information to the user.

## Usage

### Tooltip with custom placement

Tooltips can appear above, below, and to each side of the UI element depending on screen real estate and intent.

In this example the placement of the `<Tooltip>` is set to the right. By default it is set to the top. If there isn't enough space for the placement it moves to the bottom.

### Effective use of Tooltip

When using tooltips, it's essential to strike the right balance. While tooltips can provide valuable information or guidance, overloading a page with too many can confuse or overwhelm users. Focus on placing tooltips only on elements where users commonly struggle or need extra help. Limiting the number of tooltips ensures they remain effective and don't detract from the overall user experience.

    <Do.Description>
      Be strategic about placing these only on elements you know users struggle
      with. As best as you can, aim for 2-4 at most per page.

### Tooltip only shows when focused

You can use the property `trigger` to the `<Tooltip.Trigger>` and setting it to `focus`. With that you can't hover it anymore, you have to tab in with the keyboard.

<ComponentDemo file="./tooltip-focus.demo.tsx" />

### Controlled Tooltip

The open state of the tooltip can be controlled via the `open` and `onOpenChange` props.

<ComponentDemo file="./tooltip-pressed.demo.tsx" />

## Props

### Tooltip

<PropsTable component={title} />

### Tooltip.Trigger

<PropsTable component="TooltipTrigger" />
