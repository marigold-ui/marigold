A `<Toast>` is a small, temporary notification that appears on the screen to inform users about the outcome of an action or to provide brief feedback. `<Toast>`s are commonly used in applications to deliver messages such as success notifications, error alerts, or informational updates without interrupting the user's workflow.

## Usage

The `<ToastProvider>` Component should be in the root of your application, so it can be used anywhere in your app. You can use the `addToast` function to add a Toast to the Toaster. The Toast will appear at the bottom right of the screen by default. with the position prop you can change the position of all Toasts.

### Simple Toast

A `<Toast>` should be used when you want to give users quick, non-intrusive feedback after an action, such as saving, deleting, or uploading data. It appears on the edge of the screen and should remain visible for at least 5 seconds or until the user manually dismisses it. Because it doesn’t interrupt the user’s workflow, a `<Toast>` is ideal for success messages, notifications, or error alerts that don’t need immediate interaction. The message should be clear, concise, and easy to read.

### Auto dismiss

This Toast will automatically dismiss itself after a specified duration.
This is useful for notifications that do not require user interaction and should disappear after a short time. The time is in milliseconds.

### Programmatic dismiss

`addToast` does return the key of the Toast, with this the Toast can be dismissed programmatically, by saving the key of the Toast and then using `removeToast`.

All Toasts can be dismissed with `clearToasts`.
