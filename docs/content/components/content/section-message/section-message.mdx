The `<SectionMessage>` component is a block-level element designed to alert users about specific content in a designated section of the screen. It is positioned close to the relevant content to clearly indicate its connection. Section messages provide contextual feedback within a section of the page and are persistent, non-modal elements.

There are currently four different variants of the `<SectionMessage>` component provided. The `info` variant is set as default.

## Anatomy

The section message is build within a container which includes an icon (only in b2b theme) to support the message and a title. The actual content of section messages is located under the title.

Optionally, you can add a button to close the message.

## Appearance

<AppearanceDemo component={title} />

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Usage

Section messages are ideal for displaying important feedback related to a specific section of the page. Unlike modal dialogs, which interrupt the user's workflow, section messages remain visible without blocking interaction with other parts of the interface.

<Do>
  <Do.Description>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The section message title should make the topic or purpose of the
        message clear.
      </li>
      <li>
        The content provides a brief description of the event that has occurred
        on the page
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Do.Description>
</Do>

### Position

They should be positioned close to the relevant content, typically directly above, to ensure users can easily identify the relationship between the message and the affected area.
