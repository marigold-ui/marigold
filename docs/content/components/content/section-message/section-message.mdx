The `<SectionMessage>` component is a block-level element designed to alert users about specific content in a designated section of the screen. It is positioned close to the relevant content to clearly indicate its connection. Section messages provide contextual feedback within a section of the page and are persistent, non-modal elements.

## Anatomy

The section message is build within a container which includes an icon (only in b2b theme) to support the message and a title. The actual content of section messages is located under the title.

Optionally, you can add a button to dismiss the message.

## Usage

Section messages are ideal for displaying important feedback related to a specific section of the page.

Unlike modal dialogs, which interrupt the user's workflow, section messages remain visible without blocking interaction with other parts of the interface.

<Do>
  <Do.Description>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The section message title should make the topic or purpose of the
        message clear.
      </li>
      <li>
        The content provides a brief description of the event that has occurred
        on the page
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Do.Description>
</Do>

### Position

They should be positioned close to the relevant content, typically directly above, to ensure users can easily identify the relationship between the message and the affected area.

  alt="Do and donts clarity"
/>

### Dismissable message

Dismissable messages are used to provide temporary feedback or notifications that the user can manually close or dismiss when they no longer need the information. They are generally used when feedback is helpful but doesn't need to stay on screen permanently.

To provide this, you have to use the `closeButton` property on the `<SectionMessage>`.

### Actions

Actions, such as buttons or links, should be placed near the message content to make the next steps intuitive for users. Clear, accessible options help users easily respond to the feedback provided, allowing them to address the issue without disrupting their workflow.
