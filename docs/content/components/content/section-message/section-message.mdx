The `<SectionMessage>` component is a block-level element designed to alert users about specific content in a designated section of the screen. It is positioned close to the relevant content to clearly indicate its connection. Section messages provide contextual feedback within a section of the page and are persistent, non-modal elements.

There are currently four different variants of the `<SectionMessage>` component provided. The `info` variant is set as default.
