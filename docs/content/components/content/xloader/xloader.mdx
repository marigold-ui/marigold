title: XLoader
caption: Used to indicate the progress of the task.
---

The `<XLoader>` component visually indicates that a task is currently in progress. It can be used as a placeholder for content that is loading or to block interaction with the screen while waiting for a process to complete, such as data fetching or form submission. This ensures users are aware that something is happening in the background, preventing confusion and enhancing the user experience.

## Appearance

<AppearanceDemo component={title} />

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Usage

The `<XLoader>` should be used to inform users that a process is currently in progress, particularly when it takes more than a second. They are useful for situations like data fetching, form submissions, or page loads, where visual feedback reassures users that their action is being processed. However, avoid showing a loading indicator for very brief tasks, as it can feel disruptive.

### Fullscreen

The usage as a fullscreen loader should be used sparingly, only when the entire page or a critical section is inaccessible until the task completes.
