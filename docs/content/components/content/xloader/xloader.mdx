title: XLoader
caption: Used to indicate the progress of the task.
---

The `<XLoader>` component visually indicates that a task is currently in progress. It can be used as a placeholder for content that is loading or to block interaction with the screen while waiting for a process to complete, such as data fetching or form submission. This ensures users are aware that something is happening in the background, preventing confusion and enhancing the user experience.

## Appearance

<AppearanceDemo component={title} />

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Usage

The `<XLoader>` should be used to inform users that a process is currently in progress, particularly when it takes more than a second. They are useful for situations like data fetching, form submissions, or page loads, where visual feedback reassures users that their action is being processed. However, avoid showing a loading indicator for very brief tasks, as it can feel disruptive.

### Fullscreen

A fullscreen loader blocks all interactions with the underlying content, preventing users from interacting with any part of the page until the operation is finished. This can be useful in scenarios such as waiting for critical data to load during the initial app startup, processing a sensitive transaction, or handling an essential authentication step.

However, overuse of fullscreen loaders can lead to a frustrating user experience, so they should be reserved for situations where it's necessary to ensure users can't proceed until the task is fully complete.
