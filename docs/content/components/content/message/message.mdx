The `<Message>` component is used to capture the users atention to provide information. It is meant to show only very relevant information. The title should contain the most relevant information about the message.

This component should not be added on a dynymic way.

There are currently three different variants of the `<Message>` component. The `info` variant is set as default. Inside the `<Message>` it lends itself to using the [`<Text>`](/componentss/text/) component.

To import the component you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { Message } from '@marigold/components';
```

<AppearanceTable component={title} />
