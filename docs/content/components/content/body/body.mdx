title: Body
caption: Structure for contents in a content context.

The `<Body>` is a content component, like the [`<Header>`](/components/header) and [`<Footer>`](/components/footer/) and is used to help structure the contents of components such as a [`<Card>`](/components/card) or [`<Dialog>`](/components/dialog).

It behaves similar to its related components [`<Header>`](/components/header) and [`<Footer>`](/components/footer/). So the component has no properties, but that is not its task. It should wrap other components and structure its contents for a better code base.

You can set `variant` and `size` props to style your `<Body>` element.

## Usage

### Import

To import the component you just have to use this code below.

```tsx onlyCode
import { Body } from '@marigold/components';
```

### Apperance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

### Props

<PropsTable />

## Examples

### Body used in context

In this example you can see a `<Body>` element within a `<Card>`. This is a context in which the `<Body>` should be used.
