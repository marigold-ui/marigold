A `<Badge>` is a content component. This component can be used to reflect status messages via a short note and a color.

## Anatomy

It consists of a container and the content can either be a text or an icon.

## Appearance

## Usage

A `<Badge>` is a component used to provide information on new updates and notifications. It is used with other components and cannot be used alone. The content of a badge can be arbitrary, but it is preferred to use a string and/or a icon.

### Text Label Length

The Badge is a simple and compact component for use in a limited space in the context of more complex components. When it includes a text label, make sure it fits into the dedicated space.

### Color

As the Badge is used as an indicator, its color must be precise and relevant to the message that the badge conveys.
