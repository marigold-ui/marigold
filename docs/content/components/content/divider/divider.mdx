A `<Divider>` is a visual separator between two groups of content,
e.g. groups of menu items or sections of a page.

It has two specific variants given, `bold` and `section`. You can view some examples further down the page.

## Usage

### Import

To import the component you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { Divider } from '@marigold/components';
```

### Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

### Props

<PropsTable />

## Examples

### Divider between Text

This shows the default behavior of the `<Divider>`.

<ComponentDemo file="./divider-text.demo.tsx" />

### Section Divider variant

The Example shows the `variant="section"` of the `<Divider>` component. It can be used when you want to seperate some sections like e.g. `<Menu.Items>`. It has a lighter color than the default.

<ComponentDemo file="./divider-section.demo.tsx" />

### Bold Divider variant

The other variant which you can use is the `bold` one. This is a stronger line than the other variant and should be used if you want a striking seperator.

<ComponentDemo file="./divider-bold.demo.tsx" />
