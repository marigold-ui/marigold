A `<Divider>` is a visual separator between two groups of content,
e.g. groups of menu items or sections of a page.

## Anatomy

The `<Divider>` component contains a single element that can be used to create a horizontal or vertical line to separate content.

  alt="Anatomy of divider"
  width={800}
  height={550}
  className="mx-auto block"
/>

## Appearance

<AppearanceDemo component={title} />

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Usage

You should use `<Divider>` to visually separate related content, such as sections in a settings page, items in a list, or actions in a toolbar. They help improve clarity and organization without adding semantic meaning. However, dividers should be used sparingly—only when spacing alone doesn’t provide enough separation. Avoid them if they create visual clutter or when semantic elements like headings or sections are more appropriate.

### Accessibility

The `<Divider>` uses the ARIA role separator to indicate that it visually separates and distinguishes sections of content or groups of menu items.

## Props

<StorybookHintMessage component={title} />

<PropsTable component={title} />

## Alternative Components

- **Stack**: If you need to create space between elements, consider using the `<Stack>` component instead of a divider. It provides spacing without the visual line.
