The `<Text>` component is a fundamental part of Marigold's content components. It is designed to display text in a structured and visually appealing way, making it easy to read and understand.

## Anatomy

The `<Text>` consists of a single element that can be rendered as a `<div>`, `<p>`, or `<span>`. It supports various text properties such as alignment, size, weight, and color.

## AppearanceTable

<AppearanceDemo component={title} />

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Usage

The `<Text>` component is intended for all non-heading text, such as main content, detailed descriptions, and text within other components. Use it whenever you need to display standard paragraph text.

        alt="Dont use text component for headlines or titles"
      />
    </Dont.Figure>
    <Dont.Description>

### Rendering as other HTML elements

The `<Text>` component can be rendered as different HTML elements by using the `as` prop. This allows you to change the underlying element without losing the styling and behavior of the `<Text>` component.

- Use a `<p>` tag for paragraphs of text.
- Use a `<span>` for inline text inside a sentence or heading.
- Use a `<div>` for block-level layout elements without paragraph semantics.

### Customizing text

Sometimes you want to highlight text or make it stand out from the rest of the content. The `<Text>` component supports a `color` prop that allows you to change the text color. Also you can set the `weight` and `size` of the text to make it more prominent.

<ComponentDemo file="./text-color.demo.tsx" />

## Props

<StorybookHintMessage component={title} />

<PropsTable component={title} />

## Alternative Component

- **Headline**: Use the `<Headline>` component for titles and headings. It provides a more semantic structure for text that serves as a title or heading, ensuring better accessibility and SEO.
