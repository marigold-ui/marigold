The `<EmptyState>` component is used to communicate that a container, list, or page currently has no data to display. It provides visual confirmation that the lack of data is a valid system state, ensuring users do not mistake the empty space for a loading error or a bug.

It serves as a bridge between an empty screen and a populated one, offering context and guidance.

## Anatomy

The `EmptyState` component typically consists of the following elements:

<Image
  src="/emptystate/emptystate-anatomy.jpg"
  alt="Anatomy of an EmptyState"
  width={800}
  height={550}
  className="mx-auto block"
/>

## Appearance

<AppearanceDemo component={title} />
<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Usage

The `<EmptyState>` component is ideal for scenarios where a user might expect to see content, but the data set is empty despite a successful page load.

Use this component to confirm that the lack of data is a valid state in the following situations:

- **Initial States**: When a user visits a feature or dashboard for the first time and has no data due to a lack of activity.
- **User-Cleared States**: When a user has successfully resolved, deleted, or triaged all items in a list.
- **No Results (Search & Filter)**: When a list or table is empty because no items match the current search query or applied filters.

### Best Practices

Timing is critical when displaying empty states. Always show a loading indicator (Skeleton or Spinner) while data is being fetched, and only reveal the empty state after the request completes and confirms no results exist. This prevents the "Flash of Empty Content" - a jarring flicker that can confuse users and make the interface feel unstable.

It's equally important to distinguish between empty and error states. Use the `<EmptyState>` component exclusively for successful operations that return no data. For system failures, network errors, or other exceptions, use a `<Toast>` notification instead. This clear separation helps users understand whether they need to take action or simply recognize that no content exists yet.

### Content Strategy

Effective `<EmptyState>` content serves as a conversation with the user, bridging the gap between a blank screen and their first successful interaction. Because an empty screen can look like a system error, the primary goal of the copy is to provide immediate reassurance. The text must confirm that the application is working correctly and that the lack of data is a valid state.

<GuidelineTiles>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use a clear title and description to explain the empty state and guide
          users on next steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep the tone concise, human, and friendly to reassure users the
          system is working correctly.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Avoid vague titles and lack of descriptions that leave users confused
          about the empty state.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid robotic phrasing or technical jargon that might suggest the user
          made a mistake.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</GuidelineTiles>

### Accessibility

The `EmptyState` component is accessible by default through its required title, which provides screen readers with clear context about the empty state. The decorative illustration is marked with `aria-hidden="true"`, ensuring assistive technologies correctly ignore it and focus on the meaningful text content.

## Props

<PropsTable component={title} />

## Alternative components

<ul>
  <li>
    [Loader](/components/content/loader): Use for loading states before data is
    fetched. Unlike `EmptyState`, loaders indicate that content is actively
    being retrieved and will appear shortly.
  </li>
  <li>
    [Toast](/components/overlay/toast): Use for error states or system failures.
    When something goes wrong during data retrieval, a Toast provides immediate
    feedback without replacing the main content area.
  </li>
</ul>
