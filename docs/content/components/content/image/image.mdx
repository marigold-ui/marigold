title: Image
caption: Component to render images
---

The `<Image>` is a content component that renders an image on the page.

The `src` property is always required. It can be used with a link or with an image from the server's file system.

To improve accessibility, `alt` information should be provided whenever possible.
The `alt` attribute holds a text description of the image and screen readers read this description out to their users so they know what the image means. The `alt` text is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for some reason: for example, network errors, content blocking, or linkrot.

## Import

```tsx
import { Image } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Apperance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Props

<PropsTable component={title} />

## Usage

### Simple Image

In this example you can see a `<Image>` Component.

<ComponentDemo file="./image.demo.tsx" />

### Image with fit and position

In this example, the `<Image>` gets the `<fit>` property and the `<position>` property is set to bottom. You also need to wrap the `<Image>` in a `<Ratio>` component so that the fit and position properties can be used.

<ComponentDemo file="./image-fit-position.demo.tsx" />
