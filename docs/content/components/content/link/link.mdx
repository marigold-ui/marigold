The `<Link>` component is an interactive element that redirects users to different pages or sections within a website or application. It can also be used to enable file downloads, open the user's default email client to compose a new message, or show a specified address in a map application.

## Anatomy

A link consists of text that indicates what the link will direct the user to. To distinguish a link from regular text, it is usually underlined.

  className="mx-auto block"

## Appearance

<AppearanceDemo component={title} />

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Usage

Links serve as essential navigational tools in web design, enabling users to move seamlessly within an application, visit different websites or jump to specific elements on the same page. They can even be used to directly open apps to compose an email or make a call.

Using descriptive and meaningful labels for links is crucial to clearly indicate their destination. Generic phrases can leave users confused and helpless. Overusing links, especially inline, can overwhelm users and obscure their next steps. Use them sparingly to avoid clutter.

NOT: Actions that will change data, change a state, or trigger a high-emphasis action. Use Button instead.

DO: Provide a meaningful descriptive label to the link that clearly indicates the link's destination.

NOT: Use generic phrases like "click here" or "go to" on links.

### Anchor Link

This is an example of using an anchor link on the web page. If you want to use an anchor link, you must give the target the same ID (without #) as the href property in the link

<ComponentDemo file="./link-anchor.demo.tsx" />

### Link with target

An example of using the `target` `_blank` property. When the target is blank, the web page opens in a new tab.
