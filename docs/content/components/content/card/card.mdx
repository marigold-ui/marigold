A `<Card>` component is a versatile UI element used to display content in a concise, visually organized format.
It’s typically presented as a rectangular box with various content elements such as images, text, buttons, and icons.
Cards are ideal for grouping related information and making it easily digestible, often used to display previews of articles, products, user profiles, and other content types.

## Anatomy

The card component consists of a container which is basically a `<div>`. You can pass any content and components as `children` to the card component.

## Usage

The `<Card>` component can be used to present organized, summary-level information across various UI applications.
Using cards enhances the visual hierarchy and organization of content, making it easier for users to browse and engage with various pieces of information.

## Elevation layer

`<Card>` uses the raised elevation layer to create a visual distinction between the card and the background.
According to our design guidelines, the card should be used on top of the [sunken](../../../foundations/elevation#sunken) or [default](../../../foundations/elevation#default) layer
