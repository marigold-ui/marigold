The `<Headline>` component is used to create headings for different sections of content. It is a versatile component that can be styled and structured to fit various design needs while maintaining semantic HTML structure for accessibility and SEO.

## Anatomy

A `<Headline>` component typically consists of a headline element (like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) that serves as the title for a section of content.

## Appearance

<AppearanceDemo component={'Headline'} />

<AppearanceTable component={'Headline'} />

## Usage

You should use a `<Headline>` when introducing a new section or page, establishing a clear visual hierarchy, or structuring content with proper semantic headlines like `<h1>` to `<h6>`. It helps guide the reader, improves accessibility for screen readers, and ensures consistent styling across the application. Use it whenever a piece of text needs to stand out as a title or headline within your layout.

### Hierarchy

The hierarchy in the `<Headline>` component is essential for both usability and accessibility. Visually, it guides users through the content by clearly indicating the structure of a page—larger, more prominent headlines signal more important sections, while smaller ones denote subsections.

You should use the `level` prop (or `size`) to define the headline level, which corresponds to HTML headline tags (`h1`, `h2`, etc.).
