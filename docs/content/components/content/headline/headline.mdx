title: Headline
caption: Component for headlines.
---

The main task of the `<Headline>` component is to serve as a title of a content section.
It should be used when you want to structure different parts of informations. That could be the page title, text headings or the title of different content parts.

The component has a `level` property that allows you to select a number from 1-6. This is a feature for SEO optimization, so that a rendered `level="5"` can look like a HTML H2 element.

Alternatively you can set this with the `size` prop.
With the `size` prop you can style the different levels.

## Usage

### Import

```tsx
import { Headline } from '@marigold/components';
```

### Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

### Props

<PropsTable
  props={[
    {
      property: 'level',
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Set a different level from theme, values are from 1 - 6.',
      default: `1`,
    },
    {
      property: 'align',
      type: 'left | center | right',
      description: 'Set the align of the headline.',
    },
    {
      property: 'color',
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Set the color of the headline.',
    },
  ]}
