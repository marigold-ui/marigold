The `<Headline>` component is used to create headings for different sections of content. It is a versatile component that can be styled and structured to fit various design needs while maintaining semantic HTML structure for accessibility and SEO.

## Anatomy

A `<Headline>` component typically consists of a headline element (like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) that serves as the title for a section of content.

## Appearance

<AppearanceDemo component={title} />

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Usage

You should use a `<Headline>` when introducing a new section or page, establishing a clear visual hierarchy, or structuring content with proper semantic headlines like `<h1>` to `<h6>`. It helps guide the reader, improves accessibility for screen readers, and ensures consistent styling across the application. Use it whenever a piece of text needs to stand out as a title or headline within your layout.

### Hierarchy

The hierarchy in the `<Headline>` component is essential for both usability and accessibility. Visually, it guides users through the content by clearly indicating the structure of a pageâ€”larger, more prominent headlines signal more important sections, while smaller ones denote subsections.

You should use the `level` prop (or `size`) to define the headline level, which corresponds to HTML headline tags (`h1`, `h2`, etc.).

<GuidelineTiles>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
     Use headline levels in sequential order that matches the content structure.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
     Avoid skipping headline levels (e.g., from `<h1>` directly to `<h4>`) to keep your content hierarchy meaningful and accessible.

  </Dont>
