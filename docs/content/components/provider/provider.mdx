`<MarigoldProvider>` is the container for all Marigold applications. It defines the theme and other application level settings.
Without the `<MarigoldProvider>` you can't get the theme on your components. So it is necessary to use.

You just have to wrap your components around the `<MarigoldProvider>` to make it work.
It is not possible to wrap up a `<MarigoldProvider>` into another `<MarigoldProvider>` without a `selector`. The `selector` is necessary so that the global styles are not overwritten. So the inner `<MarigoldProvider>` must have a `selector`.

If you want to get more information about the setup go to [Getting Started](/introduction/getting-started/#bootstrapping).

```tsx
<MarigoldProvider theme={theme} selector="theme">
  <Button variant="primary">Hello World!</Button>
</MarigoldProvider>
```

## Usage

### Import

To import the component you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { MarigoldProvider } from '@marigold/components';
```

### Props

<PropsTable
  props={[
    {
      property: 'children',
      type: 'ReactNode',
      default: 'none',
      description: 'The children of the component.',
    },
    {
      property: 'theme',
      type: 'Theme',
      default: 'none',
      description: 'The use that should be used within the provider context.',
    },
    {
      property: 'selector',
      type: 'string',
      default: 'none',
      description:
        'By default normalization is applied globally. By specifying a selector you can scope normalization and other CSS from `theme.root` to a certain element in the DOM. This is useful if you want to run your app only on a portion of the page or are cascading themes.',
    },

]}
/>

## Examples

### Provider with Button

The example shows how the `<MarigoldProvider>` works. As simple as it is you just have to wrap the component around the provider and import a theme. You can click on the theme select on top of the page to see how the `<Button>` changes its theme.

<Preview>
  <Button variant="primary">Hello World!</Button>
</Preview>

```tsx
import { Button, MarigoldProvider } from '@marigold/components';

<MarigoldProvider theme={theme}>
  <Button variant="primary">Hello World!</Button>
</MarigoldProvider>;
```

### Provider with nested Provider

If you want to use a `<MarigoldProvider>` in another `<MarigoldProvider>` you have to set a selector on the inner one. It's necessary because you have to make clear what theme to use, without it the styles would be overwritten.

```tsx
import { MarigoldProvider } from '@marigold/components';

<MarigoldProvider theme={outerTheme}>
  <MarigoldProvider theme={innerTheme} selector="#root">
    <div id="root" />
  </MarigoldProvider>
</MarigoldProvider>;
```
