The `<LinkButton>` component provides a visually distinct, button-like element that functions as a navigational link. It combines the accessibility and semantics of a link with the appearance and interactivity of a button, making it ideal for scenarios where users need a clear call-to-action that leads to another page or resource.

## Anatomy

A link button consists of a pressable area, often containing a textual label or icon, which users can press or activate using the Space or Enter keys.

## Usage

A link button should be used whenever the primary user action is navigation. It is the ideal choice when you need the visual prominence of a button for a call-to-action that directs the user to a different page or URL. For example, a "Sign Up Now" or "Learn More" element that takes the user to a new registration or features page is a perfect use case. Using a link button ensures that standard browser behaviors, such as opening a link in a new tab or copying the address, are preserved.

In contrast, a regular button is meant for performing an action on the current page. You should use a regular button when the user is submitting a form, opening a modal window, toggling a setting, or saving data without changing the URL. Essentially, if the component's purpose is to _do something_ on the current view, use a button. If it is meant to _go somewhere_ else, use a link button.

  <SectionMessage.Content>
    <Stack space={2}>
      <p>
        The link button is the button's visual twin, so it must follow all the
        same guidelines. The only difference is that it's a link used for
        navigation.
      </p>
      <Link href="/components/actions/button">View button guidelines</Link>
    </Stack>
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>
