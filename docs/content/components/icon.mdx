# Icon

## Installation

### 1. React component:

Marigold Icons have a seperate package to install.
The first option is to install the package and use the Icons like other React components and as in the code example below.
You have to specify the name of the icon directly between the `< />` brackets.

```bash onlyCode
# with npm
npm install @marigold/icons --save

yarn add @marigold/icons
```

### 2. HTML SVG Element

The second option is to go to [Marigold Icons](../../foundation/icons) and click on an Icon in the list to copy them as `<svg>` Element

## Description

By adding the `size` prop you can change to another size. `24` is the default size.
The `fill` prop is the second attribute and per default `currentcolor`.
