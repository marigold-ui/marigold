The `<TextField>` is a form component which allows user to enter text with a keyboard. It consists of a label, an input field and a help text. The latter also contains error messages.

It has many properties that it brings with it. You can set label for labeling the `<TextField>` itself, a `description` which behaves as help text. It is also possible to add error messages by adding the `error` and `errorMessage` prop. Another often used property is the `required` prop. You can also write all other HTML input properties down.

The `<FieldGroup>` is a component to layout the label and the fieldbase itself. On that you can use `labelWidth` which is a string type to set the width of the label. Because the label is set to the left side in the core theme, it has only an impact on that.
