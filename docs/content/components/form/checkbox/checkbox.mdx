The `<Checkbox>` component allows users to select one or more options from a set of options. In order to group multiple checkboxes, use the `<CheckboxGroup>` component.

There are several props for the `<Checkbox>` and the `<CheckboxGroup>`, allowing customization of behavior, appearance, and accessibility.

You don't have to click on the `<Checkbox>` itself, you can also just click on the label next to the box, making it more user-friendly and accessible.

The `<Checkbox>` component supports both controlled and uncontrolled states, giving you flexibility in how you manage the selection.

## Anatomy

The checkbox component is comprised of a checkbox label and a checkbox input. If there is a group of checkboxes, a group label can be added.

  alt="Anatomy of a checkbox"
  width={800}
  height={550}
  className="mx-auto block"
/>

- **Group label:** Communicates what needs to be selected below.

- **Radio button input:** A checkbox input indicating the appropriate state. By default it is unselected.

- **Radio button label:** Describes the information you want to select or unselect.

## Appearance

<AppearanceDemo component={title} />

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Usage

Checkboxes are used when there are multiple items to select in a list. Each checkbox works independently from other checkboxes in the list, therefore checking an additional box does not affect any other selections. Users can select zero, one, or any number of items.

Checkboxes are particularly useful in settings where users need to make non-exclusive selections. They provide a clear and straightforward way to toggle options on or off. When used in a group, they can help simplify complex decision-making processes. Additionally, checkboxes can be combined with other form elements, such as dropdowns to create more dynamic and interactive forms.

## Props

### Checkbox

<PropsTable component={title} />

### Checkbox.Group

<PropsTable component="CheckboxGroup" />

## Examples

### Checkbox disabled

Here you can see how the `disabled` property is to use.

<ComponentDemo file="./checkbox-disabled.demo.tsx" />

### Indeterminate Checkbox

Use indeterminate state when it represents both selected and not selected values.

<ComponentDemo file="./checkbox-indeterminate.demo.tsx" />

### Group checkboxes

In this example the `<Checkbox>` are wrapped within the `<CheckboxGroup>`. You see that the `onChange` property is also set. It has also a helptext within which you can set with the `description` property for the `<CheckboxGroup>`.

<ComponentDemo file="./checkbox-group.demo.tsx" />
