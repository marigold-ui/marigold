The `<Checkbox>` component allows users to select one or more options from a set of options. In order to group multiple checkboxes, use the `<CheckboxGroup>` component.

There are several props for the `<Checkbox>` and the `<CheckboxGroup>`, allowing customization of behavior, appearance, and accessibility.

You don't have to click on the `<Checkbox>` itself, you can also just click on the label next to the box, making it more user-friendly and accessible.

The `<Checkbox>` component supports both controlled and uncontrolled states, giving you flexibility in how you manage the selection.

## Anatomy

The checkbox component is comprised of a checkbox label and a checkbox input. If there is a group of checkboxes, a group label can be added.

  className="mx-auto block"
/>

- **Group label:** Communicates what needs to be selected below.

- **Radio button input:** A checkbox input indicating the appropriate state. By default it is unselected.

- **Radio button label:** Describes the information you want to select or unselect.

In this example the `<Checkbox>` are wrapped within the `<CheckboxGroup>`. You see that the `onChange` property is also set. It has also a helptext within which you can set with the `description` property for the `<CheckboxGroup>`.
