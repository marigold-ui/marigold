The `<DateField>` allows users to enter and edit date values using a keyboard. Each part of a date value is displayed in an individually editable segment.

The `<DateField>` segments are individually focusable and editable by the user, by typing or using the arrow keys to increment and decrement the value. This approach allows values to be formatted and parsed correctly regardless of the locale or date format, and offers an easy and error-free way to edit dates using the keyboard.

## Anatomy

A `<DateField>` consists of a label, and a group of segments representing each unit of a date and time (e.g. years, months, days).

## Usage

The `<DateField>` component is a versatile input element used for selecting dates in forms. It enhances user experience by providing a structured way to input date information, reducing errors associated with manual entry. With features like labels and descriptions, it clearly communicates its purpose to users. The component can also support default values. Overall, the `<DateField>` is essential for applications requiring date selection, ensuring both accessibility and usability.

### Disabled DateField

You can disable the `<DateField>` so that the user can't interact with it anymore.

<ComponentDemo file="./date-field-disabled.demo.tsx" />

### Required DateField

If you want a `<DateField>` to be required, you just have to add the property `required`. With that the small required icon appears next to the label.

This example shows how to use the `error` with the `errorMessage`.
