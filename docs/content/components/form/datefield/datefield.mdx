title: DateField
caption: Component for input forms.

The `<DateField>` allows users to enter and edit date values using a keyboard. Each part of a date value is displayed in an individually editable segment.

The `<DateField>` segments are individually focusable and editable by the user, by typing or using the arrow keys to increment and decrement the value. This approach allows values to be formatted and parsed correctly regardless of the locale or date format, and offers an easy and error-free way to edit dates using the keyboard.

## Import

```tsx
import { DateField } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Props

<PropsTable componentFile="DateField.tsx" />

## Examples

### Simple DateField

This example shows a regular `<DateField>` without any special props.

<ComponentDemo file="./date-field-basic.demo.tsx" />

### Disabled DateField

You can disable the `<DateField>` so that the user can't interact with it anymore.

<ComponentDemo file="./date-field-disabled.demo.tsx" />

### Required DateField

If you want a `<DateField>` to be required, you just have to add the property `required`. With that the small required icon appears next to the label.

<ComponentDemo file="./date-field-required.demo.tsx" />

### DateField With an Error

This example shows how to use the `error` with the `errorMessage`.

<ComponentDemo file="./date-field-error.demo.tsx" />
