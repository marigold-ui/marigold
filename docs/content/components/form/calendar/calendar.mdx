The `<Calendar>` is a date selection interface that allows you to choose a date using a calendar view.

## Anatomy

The `<Calendar>` consists of a header and a grid section. Inside of the header there are two select lists, one for a month and one for the year. In the grid section there is a grid of selectable dates which you can also enter through keyboard navigation to select a date.
