Multiselect is a type of multiple selection interface that displays options in a list format with the ability to select multiple items.

It allows users to choose multiple options by clicking on the items in the list and provides a comprehensive view of available options and the selected items.

  <SectionMessage.Title>Deprecated Multiselect Recipe</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    The previous multiselect recipe pattern has been replaced by this official
    MultiSelect component. Existing implementations using the recipe pattern
    should migrate to this component for better accessibility and keyboard
    navigation.

## Anatomy

The `<MultiSelect>` component combines a text input with a ListBox, enabling users to select multiple options that are displayed as removable tags within the input field.

## Usage

The `<MultiSelect>` component works best when users need to select multiple items from a large list of options (10+) and see their choices displayed as compact tags directly in the input. Itâ€™s helpful when you want to combine filtering (typing to narrow options) with visible selection feedback, saving space compared to checkboxes while allowing users to dynamically add or remove tags during the selection process.

### Controlled

The `onSelectionChange` and `onChange` props can be used to control the `Multiselect`.
