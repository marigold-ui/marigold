title: Form
caption: Wrap your fields to submit user data and enable input validation.
---

The `<Form>` component acts as a container for a set of fields, enabling data transmission to a server. It operates like a standard HTML form, initiating either a request based on the specified `method` attribute.

Additionally, the `<Form>` allows to validate user input and offers feedback for incorrect data entries, enhancing the overall resilience and user-friendliness of the form submission process. See the [Validation](/concepts/validation) guide to learn more about form validation.

## Usage

### Import

To import the component you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { Form } from '@marigold/components';
```

### Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

### Props

<PropsTable
  props={[
    {
      property: 'validationErrors',
      type: 'Record<string, string | string[]>',
      description:
        'Validation errors for the form, typically returned by a server. This should be set to an object mapping from input names to errors.',
      default: '-',
    },
    {
      property: 'action',
      type: `string | FormHTMLAttributes<HTMLFormElement>['action']`,
      description:
        'Endpoint where to send the form-data when the form is submitted.',
      default: '-',
    },
    {
      property: 'method',
      type: `'get' | 'post' | 'dialog'`,
      description: 'The HTTP method to submit the form with.',
      default: '-',
    },
    {
      property: 'onSubmit',
      type: `(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => void`,
      description: 'Triggered when a user submits the form.',
      default: '-',
    },
    {
      property: 'onReset',
      type: `(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => void`,
      description: 'Triggered when a user resets the form.',
      default: '-',
    },
    {
      property: 'onInvalid',
      type: `(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => void`,
      description:
        'Triggered for each invalid field when a user submits the form.',
      default: '-',
    },
    {
      property: '...',
      type: '',
      description: 'Yes you can use all regular attributes of `form`!',
      default: '',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Examples

### Setup

This is a simple setup how to use a `<Form>`.

<ComponentDemo file="./form-base.demo.tsx" />

### Handling submission

The `onSubmit` event is useful for custom form actions, such as calling a REST API, instead of relying on the native form submission. It triggeres when a user submits the form using the Enter key or clicks the submit button. The `onReset` event is triggered when a user presses a reset button (`[type=reset]`).

<ComponentDemo file="./form-submission.demo.tsx" />

### Server Errors

The `<Form>` component handles passed errors, typically received from a server after form submission. To display validation errors, set the `validationErrors` prop as an object mapping each field's name prop to a string or array of strings representing errors. These errors appear to the user as soon as the `validationErrors` prop is set and are cleared when the user modifies the corresponding field's value.

<ComponentDemo file="./form-validation-errors.demo.tsx" />

For more information about form validation, see the [Validation](/concepts/validation) guide.

### Focus Management

As you can see in the previous server errors example, when a user submits a form with validation errors, the first invalid field is automatically focused. This behavior can be customized using `e.preventDefault` during the `onInvalid` event and manage the focus manually.
