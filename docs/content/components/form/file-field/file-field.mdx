The `<FileField>` component allows users to upload files to your application. It provides both a drag and drop area and a traditional file browser button, making it easy for users to select files in the way that works best for them.

File uploads are commonly used in forms where users need to attach documents, images, or other files such as resumes for job applications, profile pictures for accounts, or supporting materials for requests.

## Anatomy

A `<FileField>` consists of a label, a drop zone where users can drag files, a zone label providing instructions, and an upload button for browsing files. Once files are selected, they appear as file items in a list, each showing the file name, size, and a remove button.

## Usage

The `<FileField>` is useful whenever users need to attach files to a form or upload content to your application. It supports both drag and drop interaction and traditional file browsing, providing flexibility for different user preferences and device capabilities.

### Uploading files

When users need to attach a single file, such as a profile picture or a document, use the basic `<FileField>`. Users can either drag a file into the drop zone or click the upload button to browse their files.

<ComponentDemo file="./file-field-basic.demo.tsx" />

### Uploading multiple files

When users need to upload several files at once, such as multiple photos for a gallery or supporting documents for an application, set the `multiple` prop to allow selecting and uploading multiple files.

This allows users to select multiple files in the file browser or drag several files into the drop zone at once.

<ComponentDemo file="./file-field-multiple.demo.tsx" />

### Restricting file types

For specific use cases where only certain file types are appropriate, such as accepting only PDFs for document uploads or only images for profile pictures, use the `accept` prop to specify allowed file types. This helps prevent errors and guides users toward selecting appropriate files.

<ComponentDemo file="./file-field-restrict.demo.tsx" />

The `accept` prop accepts an array of MIME types (like `'application/pdf'` or `'image/*'`) or file extensions (like `'.pdf'` or `'.jpg'`). Users will only be able to select files that match these criteria, and dropped files that don't match will be filtered out automatically.
