The `<SearchField>` component is a versatile UI element that enables users to search for specific information within a given context or data set. It offers a user-friendly input field specifically designed for search queries, often accompanied by a search icon or button to initiate the search action.

`<SearchField>` consists of an input element, a label, and an optional clear button. `<SearchField>` automatically manages the labeling and relationships between the elements, and handles keyboard events. Users can press the Escape key to clear the `<SearchField>`, or the Enter key to trigger the `onSubmit` event.

## Examples

### Simple Search Field

### Disabled Search Field

If you want to implement a disabled `<SearchField>` you have to add the `disabled` property.

<ComponentDemo file="./search-field-disabled.demo.tsx" />

### Required Search Field

The `required` property adds an required icon to the label.

<ComponentDemo file="./search-field-req.demo.tsx" />
