The `<Select>` is a form component to choose one option from a list. A `<Select>` must include the `<Select.Item>`. It can optionally include a `<Select.Section>`, which behaves as divider between two or more category options.

It behaves similar to the [`<Menu>`](/components/menu/), but the use case is different. A `<Select>` is used in forms.

## Import

```tsx
import { Select } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Props

### Select

<PropsTable component={title} />

### Select.Section

<PropsTable component="ListBoxSection" />

### Select.Option

<PropsTable component="ListBoxItem" />

## Examples

### Standard Select

This example shows a common single select. It supports an optional description which can be used to provide more context about the field.

<ComponentDemo file="./select-basic.demo.tsx" />

### Select with Sections

In this example you can see how to use the `<Select.Section>` in the `<Select>` itself. A clear line appears to separate different options, and you can set the title of `<Select.Section>` by using `<Header>` component inside `<Select.Section>` .

<ComponentDemo file="./select-section.demo.tsx" />

### Item description

If you need to have primary and secondary content shown within an item, you can use the `description` property on the option to write a short description.

<ComponentDemo file="./select-description.demo.tsx" />

### Disabled Keys

You can also set some keys disabled, for that you have to use the `disabledKeys` property.

<ComponentDemo file="./select-disabled-keys.demo.tsx" />
