The `<Select>` is a form component with which you can choose exactly one option from a list with predefined options. It should be used with other form components in a [`<Form>`](../form/form/).

## Anatomy

A select contains a pressable button element with a down arrow. The lists of options opens per default below the button, if there is no space for it, it will open above. An option represent a possible choice the user can select.

Optional you have the choice to add a section to the options which helps divide the content of options in categories. You can have the possibility to add a supporting text as short description and/ or error message to the select itself. The description will be relplaced with the error message when an error throws.
Also you can have a description for the options in the list.

## Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Usage

The select should be used within a form. It supports an optional description which can be used to provide more context about the field.
As with all form components, the label should always describe what the user expects to achieve. If additional informations is required you can use the description to give a short information for displaying these, or you can provide a placeholder which should represent what is to select.

    Don't use a select if there are less than three options to choose from. Use
    a [radio group](../form/radio) instead.

### Select with Sections

Use sections when it is helpful to group different options from each other, this can be for example to categorize related options together. For that you habe to use the `<Select.Section>` component. A clear line appears to separate different options, and you can set the title of `<Select.Section>` by using `<Header>` component inside `<Select.Section>`.

<ComponentDemo file="./select-section.demo.tsx" />

### Item description

If you need to have primary and secondary content shown within an option, you can use our [text component](../content/text) with the slot property and set it for the label and description to add a short description for secondary content, which provides more context for the certain selectable option.

<ComponentDemo file="./select-description.demo.tsx" />

### Disabled Keys

Sometimes depending on other settings it can be that a select needs to have disabled options to show up. For this case you can set keys disabled through the `disabledKeys` property.

<ComponentDemo file="./select-disabled-keys.demo.tsx" />
