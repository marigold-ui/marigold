The `<Select>` is a form component with which you can choose one option from a list with predefined options. It should be used with other form components in a `<Form>`.

## Anatomy

A `<Select>` contains a clickable button element with an arrow down icon to show the direction the list of options opens. `<Select.Option>` represent a possible choice the user can select. Optional you have the choice to add `<Select.Section>` to the options which helps divide the content of options in categories if needed. Also optional you have the possibility to add a short description to the select itself and/ or to the option.

## Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Usage

This example shows a common single select. It supports an optional description which can be used to provide more context about the field.

<ComponentDemo file="./select-basic.demo.tsx" />

### Select with Sections

In this example you can see how to use the `<Select.Section>` in the `<Select>` itself. A clear line appears to separate different options, and you can set the title of `<Select.Section>` by using `<Header>` component inside `<Select.Section>`.

<ComponentDemo file="./select-section.demo.tsx" />

### Item description

If you need to have primary and secondary content shown within an item, you can use the `description` property on the option to write a short description.

<ComponentDemo file="./select-description.demo.tsx" />

### Disabled Keys

You can also set some keys disabled, for that you have to use the `disabledKeys` property.

<ComponentDemo file="./select-disabled-keys.demo.tsx" />
