---

The `<Radio>` and `<Radio.Group>` components allow users to select one option from a set of options. They are useful for presenting a list of options to users and collecting their responses.

The `<Radio>` should never be used alone, there should always be at least two `<Radio>` from which you can choose. For that the `<Radio.Group>` should be wrapped around the `<Radio>`. If you want one option you could use the [`<Checkbox>`](/components/checkbox/) instead.

The `<Radio.Group>` not only groups the radio buttons but also manages their state. This means you can easily control which option is selected by default and dynamically update the selection based on user interactions.

```tsx
import { Radio } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Anatomy

The radio button component is comprised of a set of clickable circles (the inputs) with text labels positioned to the right. If there is a group of radio buttons, a group label can be added.

- **Group label:** Describes the group of options or provides guidance for making a selection.

- **Radio button input:** Indicates the state of a radio button. By default, no option will be preselected.

- **Radio button label:** Describes the information you want to select or unselect.

<PropsTable component="RadioGroup" />

## Examples

### Simple Radio

In this example you can see a simple `<Radio.Group>` within `<Radio>`. There is also a single `<Radio>` disabled.

<ComponentDemo file="./radio.demo.tsx" />

### Disabed Radio

Here you can see a complete disabled `<Radio.Group>`. You can also just disable single `<Radio>`.

<ComponentDemo file="./radio-disabled.demo.tsx" />

### Required Radio with horizontal orientation

In this example the `<Radio.Group>` is required and the `orientation` is set to `horizontal`. With these props you can determine the direction of the `<Radio>` options.

<ComponentDemo file="./radio-required.demo.tsx" />

### Error Radio

In this example you can see how an `errorMessage` would look on a `<RadioGroup>`.

<ComponentDemo file="./radio-error.demo.tsx" />
