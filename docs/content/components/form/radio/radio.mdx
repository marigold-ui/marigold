title: Radio
caption: Component which allows to select only one option from a list.

The `<Radio>` and `<Radio.Group>` components allow users to select one option from a set of options. They are useful for presenting a list of options to users and collecting their responses.

The `<Radio>` should never be used alone, there should always be at least two `<Radio>` from which you can choose. For that the `<Radio.Group>` should be wrapped around the `<Radio>`. If you want one option you could use the [`<Checkbox>`](/components/checkbox/) instead.

## Import

```tsx
import { Radio } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Props

### Radio

<PropsTable componentFile="Radio.tsx" />

### Radio.Group

<PropsTable componentFile="RadioGroup.tsx" />

## Examples

### Simple Radio

In this example you can see a simple `<Radio.Group>` within `<Radio>`. There is also a single `<Radio>` disabled.

<ComponentDemo file="./radio.demo.tsx" />

### Disabed Radio

Here you can see a complete disabled `<Radio.Group>`. You can also just disable single `<Radio>`.

<ComponentDemo file="./radio-disabled.demo.tsx" />

### Required Radio with horizontal orientation

In this example the `<Radio.Group>` is required and the `orientation` is set to `horizontal`. With these props you can determine the direction of the `<Radio>` options.

<ComponentDemo file="./radio-required.demo.tsx" />

### Error Radio

In this example you can see how an `errorMessage` would look on a `<RadioGroup>`.

<ComponentDemo file="./radio-error.demo.tsx" />
