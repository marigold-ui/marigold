The `<TextField>` is a form component which allows user to enter and edit text with a keyboard. They typically appear in forms and dialogs.

## Import

```tsx
import { TextField } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Props

<PropsTable component={title} />

## Examples

### Basic Text Field

The `TextField` component consists of a label, an input field and a help text.

<ComponentDemo file="./textfield-basic.demo.tsx" />

### Form props

Standard form attributes are supported like `required`, `disabled`, `type`, `placeholder` etc. as well as a `description` which is used to give context about a field's input, such as how the input will be used.

<ComponentDemo file="./textfield-props.demo.tsx" />

### Validation

The `error` prop toggles the error state of a field. The `errorMessage` prop can then be used to provide feedback to the user about the error. The message disappears automatically when all requirements are met.

<ComponentDemo file="./textfield-error.demo.tsx" />

### Width

`TextField` also supports the `width` property. For this you can mainly us all available [spacing tokens](../../introduction/design-tokens#spacing).
But there also some special tokens like `auto`, `fit`, `max`, `full` or even relative values like `3/5`.

<ComponentDemo file="./textfield-width.demo.tsx" />

### Uncontrolled vs. Controlled

The component can be uncontrolled or controlled ([see also](../../patterns/building-forms#controlled-or-uncontrolled-components))

<ComponentDemo file="./textfield-controlled.demo.tsx" />

### type="number"

<SectionMessage variant="warning">
  <SectionMessage.Title>Note</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    We do not recommend using `type="number"` with a `TextField` due to
    potential usability issues. For more information see
    [here](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/24/why-the-gov-uk-design-system-team-changed-the-input-type-for-numbers/)
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

If you need a text field with number validation, you can use [NumberField](./number-field) instead.

### Using with FieldGroup

<SectionMessage variant="info">
  <SectionMessage.Title>Note</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    `<FieldGroup>` is build to layout the label and the form field itself. On that you can
    use `labelWidth` which is a string type to set the width of the label.
    Because the label is set to the left side in the `core-theme`, it has only
    an impact on that.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

This example shows how to use the `<FieldGroup>` together with some form components like the `<TextField>` and `<Radio>`.

<ComponentDemo file="./textfield-group.demo.tsx" />
