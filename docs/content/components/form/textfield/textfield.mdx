The `<TextField>` is a form component which allows user to enter text with a keyboard. It creates interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user.

The `<TextField>` element is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML due to the sheer number of combinations of input types and attributes.

<SectionMessage>
  <SectionMessage.Title>Note</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    The `<FieldGroup>` is a component to layout the label and the fieldbase itself. On that you can use `labelWidth`
    which is a string type to set the width of the label. It's needed only when using the <strong>core</strong> theme.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

## Anatomy

Text fields consist of an input element, which is a container in which the user enters data, and a label which informs the user about the content they need to enter in the field.
`<TextField>` automatically manages the relationship between these two elements. It also supports optional description
and error message elements, which can be used to provide more
context about the field, and any validation messages.

## Usage

Use a `<TextField>` if a user needs to input unique information that cannot be predicted with a preset of options and
also a user needs to input memorable data that can be entered more quickly in a free-hand format versus a more
complex
control.

    Avoid using `<TextField>` if a user can only enter an option from a predefined list then avoid using a free-form
      text
      input as it is likely to result in an error. Consider using a selection control such as a dropdown, select, or
      radio
      button group instead.

      ### Label
      In general label should be short and precise about what is expected from the user. Avoid unnecessary instructional
      verbs (doing words) in your labels and hints because it’s already implied by the input field.
      Avoid placeholder text in most cases, as there’s no need for it (more about it in the next section).

      ### Placeholder

      Placeholder text is a short hint displayed inside an input field before
      a user enters a value. To save space, placeholder text is often used instead of a label, as shown in the first
      example.
      This is problematic for the following reasons:
      * Placeholder text disappears once a person starts filling in an input field, causing some to forget what the
      field
      was for
      * Some might miss or skip fields with placeholder text, as it can look like the field has already been pre-filled.
      * Placeholder text colour contrast is almost always inaccessible, as it’s very light by design. This means many
      will
      struggle to read the label.

      ### Additional description
      Sometimes the label isn't enough for the user. In this case, to gather additional support for the user we can use
      the
      help text. With this we can add helpful hints for the user below the input field. Beside that the help text is
      placed
      in close proximity to the associated input field.

      ### Textfield with an error

      Error messages should let people know that a problem occurred, why it happened, and provide a solution to fix it
      and move forward.

      Quick tips to keep in mind when writing error messages:
      * Never blame the user. Always be positive and helpful
      * Be concise and avoid unnecessary words like “please”, “sorry” and “oops”
      * use detailed messages instead of global messages

The example shows how to set the `error` and `errorMessage` properties. If you fill in the field correctly, it
will disappear automatically.

      ## Alternative components

      Choosing the right alternative to data tables is crucial for effectively displaying your data and enhancing user
      interaction. Depending on the type of data and the desired user experience, different components can offer
      different
      benefits. Here are some alternatives to data tables that might better suit your needs:
