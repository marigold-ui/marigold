The `<TextField>` is a form component which allows user to enter text with a keyboard. It consists of a label, an input field and a help text. The latter also contains error messages.

It has many properties that it brings with it. You can set label for labeling the `<TextField>` itself, a `description` which behaves as help text. It is also possible to add error messages by adding the `error` and `errorMessage` prop. Another often used property is the `required` prop.

The `<FieldGroup>` is a component to layout the label and the fieldbase itself. On that you can use `labelWidth` which is a string type to set the width of the label. Because the label is set to the left side in the core theme, it has only an impact on that.

## Import

```tsx
import { TextField } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Props

<PropsTable component={title} />

## Examples

### Simple Text Field

This is how a basic `<TextField>` can look like.

<ComponentDemo file="./textfield-basic.demo.tsx" />

### Disabled Text Field

If you want to implement a disabled `<TextField>` you have to add the `disabled` property.

<ComponentDemo file="./textfield-disabled.demo.tsx" />

### Required Text Field

The `required` property adds an required icon to the label.

<ComponentDemo file="./textfield-req.demo.tsx" />

### Text Field with an Error

The example shows how to set the `error` and `errorMessage` properties. If you fill in the field correctly, it will disappear automatically.

<ComponentDemo file="./textfield-error.demo.tsx" />

### Not every number is a `number`!

[Just because the input contains numbers, it is not necessarily correctly to use `input[type=number]`!](https://www.coywolf.news/webmaster/accessible-number-input/) You can also see in the example how the `errorMessage` behaves if a false value is written in the input and how many possibilities you have using props.

<ComponentDemo file="./textfield-number.demo.tsx" />

### Use different input methods

In this example you can see different types of inputs, like `email`, `date` or `tel`.

<ComponentDemo file="./textfield-types.demo.tsx" />

### Using with FieldGroup

This example shows how to use the `<FieldGroup>` together with some form components like the `<TextField>` and `<Radio>`. It is build for the Core and has only impact of that.

<ComponentDemo file="./textfield-group.demo.tsx" />
