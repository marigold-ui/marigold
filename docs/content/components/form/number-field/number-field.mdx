title: NumberField
caption: Component for entering numbers.
---

The `<NumberField>` component allows users to enter numbers with a keyboard. This includes plain numbers as well as percentages, decimals and sums of money.

It consists of a label, an input field and a help text. The latter also includes error messages.

A special propertiy is the `hideStepper` prop, with that you can choose if you want to hide the buttons for adding/ removing values. You can also set all properties from the regular HTML input element.

## Import

```tsx
import { NumberField } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Props

<PropsTable componentFile="NumberField.tsx" />

## Examples

### Simple Number Field

This example shows a regular `<NumberField>` without any special props.

<ComponentDemo file="./number-field-simple.demo.tsx" />

### Disabled Number Field

You can disable the `<NumberField>` so that the user can't interact with it anymore.

<ComponentDemo file="./number-field-disabled.demo.tsx" />

### Required Number Field

If you want a `<NumberField>` to be required, you just have to add the property `required`. With that the small required icon appears next to the label.

<ComponentDemo file="./number-field-required.demo.tsx" />

### Number Field with an Error

This example shows how to use the `error` with the `errorMessage`.

<ComponentDemo file="./number-field-error.demo.tsx" />

### Min and max Values

The example shows how to use the `minValue` and the `maxValue`. You can see that you can't get under "0" or above "100". If you try to, the step buttons will be disabled.

<ComponentDemo file="./number-field-values.demo.tsx" />

### Step Amount

The `step` property sets the amount of steps the input should use. Default is set to "1".

<ComponentDemo file="./number-field-amount.demo.tsx" />

### Hide Stepper

If you don't want the step buttons to appear, you can easily remove these with the `hideStepper` property.

<ComponentDemo file="./number-field-hide.demo.tsx" />

### Display different Format Options

In this example you can see how different `<NumberFields>` can look like. You can choose between all `Intl.NumberFormatOptions`. In this case you can see `percent`,`unit`, `decimal` and `currency`.

<ComponentDemo file="./number-field-format.demo.tsx" />
