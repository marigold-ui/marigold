The `<DatePicker>` component is a user interface element that allows users to select a date from a calendar.

The typical practice is to provide a date picker and when you click on date picker button it pops up a calendar below the date picker, allowing the user to populate the field with an appropriate date.

## Import

```tsx
import { DatePicker } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Props

<PropsTable componentFile="DatePicker.tsx" />

## Examples

### Simple (uncontrolled)

This example shows a regular `<DatePicker>` without any special props.

<ComponentDemo file="./date-picker-basic.demo.tsx" />

### Disabled

You can disable the `<DatePicker>` so that the user can't interact with it anymo re.

<ComponentDemo file="./date-picker-disabled.demo.tsx" />

### Required

If you want a `<DatePicker>` to be required, you just have to add the property `required`. With that the small required icon appears next to the label.

<ComponentDemo file="./date-picker-required.demo.tsx" />

### With an Error

This example shows how to use the `error` with the `errorMessage`.

<ComponentDemo file="./date-picker-error.demo.tsx" />

### DatePicker with min/max Values

The `minValue` and `maxValue` props can also be used to perform builtin validation. This prevents the user from selecting dates outside the valid range in the calendar .

<ComponentDemo file="./date-picker-min-max.demo.tsx" />

### Controlled

The `value` and `onChange` props can be used to control the `DatePicker`.

<ComponentDemo file="./date-picker-controlled.demo.tsx" />

### Using a Date Object

When using a datepicker, relying on the standard JavaScript `Date` object for its value can result in timezone inconsistencies and incorrect date display. That's why the datepicker uses a specific `DateValue` type from [@internationalized/date](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/) instead. This library handles correct international date manipulation across calendars, time zones, and other localization concerns.

<SectionMessage type="info">
  <SectionMessage.Title>@internationalized/date</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    `@internationalized/date` is a peer dependency. If it's not already in your
    project, you'll need to install it.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

The simplest way to parse a Date for the datepicker is by using `parseAbsoluteToLocal`. This function converts an absolute date and time into the current user's local time zone.
If you're already using a date library like [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/), you can also utilizing `parseDate`. Ensure that you only pass the date part to `parseDate`, excluding the time and timezone information.
