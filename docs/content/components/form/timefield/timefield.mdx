The `<TimeField>` allows users to enter and edit date values using a keyboard. Each part of a time value is displayed in an individually editable segment. These segments are individually focusable and editable by the user, by typing or using the arrow keys to increment and decrement the value. This approach allows values to be formatted and parsed correctly regardless of the locale and offers an easy and error-free way to edit dates using the keyboard.

## Anatomy

A `<TimeField>` consists of a label and a group of segments representing each unit of a time, such as hours, minutes and seconds.
