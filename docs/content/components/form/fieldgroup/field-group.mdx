title: FieldGroup
caption: A component for organizing and structuring form data on the layout level.
---

The `<FieldGroup>` designed primarily for handling of complex forms and semantic representation of fields structure and the layout in `theme-core` .

<SectionMessage type="info">
  <SectionMessage.Title>For your information!</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
The `<FieldGroup>` is a component to layout the label and the fieldbase itself. On that you can use `labelWidth` which is a string type to set the width of the label. Because the label is set to the left side in the `core-theme`, it has only an impact on that.
</SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>
