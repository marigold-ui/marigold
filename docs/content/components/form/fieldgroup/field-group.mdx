The `<FieldGroup>` designed primarily for handling of complex forms and semantic representation of fields structure and the layout in `theme-core` .

  <Message.Title>For your information!</Message.Title>
  <Message.Content>
The `<FieldGroup>` is a component to layout the label and the fieldbase itself. On that you can use `labelWidth` which is a string type to set the width of the label. Because the label is set to the left side in the `core-theme`, it has only an impact on that.
