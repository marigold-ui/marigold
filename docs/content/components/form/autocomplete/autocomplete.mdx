The `<Autocomplete>` component is an input field that offers suggestions for the user's input as they type. These proposals are based on a predefined set of options.

It also helps to reduce the effort and time required to input data and to avoid errors that can occur due to typos or misspellings. The suggestions are displayed in a combobox list, and the user can select one of the options or continue typing their own input.

## Anatomy

Autocomplete is made up of a form input field, label, and overlay of menu options. The label and description aren't required and may be visually hidden. The clear button is shown after typing starts.

## Usage

Use an autocomplete search field (also known as a predictive search) to help users find what they’re looking for faster.
An autocomplete search field displays suggestions as someone types into the field, just like the Google search bar.
It is also suitable for fields where people know what they’re looking for, e.g. country of birth, a particular event, or a particular city.

### Text Label

The label of the `<Autocomplete>` provides a clear and concise description of its purpose, making it easier for users to
interact with the interface and understand it.
Always display a label unless the `<Autocomplete>` is next to another component which already has a label.

    ### Item Content

    Consider the width of the Autocomplete and keep the names of the options short and compact so that they fit. Long
    item
    names that occupy multiple lines are hard to perceive and should be avoided.
