The `<Autocomplete>` component is a form element with an associated popup that enables users to select a value from a collection of suggested values. Uusers may either select one of the suggestions from the popup or type a value.

Suggestions are represented by the `<Autocomplete.Item>` component that must be used as children of the `<Autocomplete>` component.

## Examples

### Uncontrolled Usage

The following example shows how to use the `Autocomplete` component in an uncontrolled manner. States, such as the user typing into the input or updating the suggestions, are automatically handled by the component. The `onSubmit` handler will be called when the user chooses a suggestion or submits their custom value.

<ComponentDemo file="./autocomplete-uncontrolled.demo.tsx" />

### Controlled Usage with custom Filter

If you want to listen or act while the user is typing into the `Autocomplete` field, you can switch to controlled mode by adding an `onChange` handler and setting the `value` manually.

This is especially helpful if you need to customize the filtering. For example, you may only want to show suggestions when the user has typed at least two characters. Furthermore, you can improve the matching, as shown in the example below. In the demo, the user would not receive a suggestion if they typed "ssp" without the custom filter.

<ComponentDemo file="./autocomplete-controlled.demo.tsx" />

### Working with asynchronous Data

The Autocomplete component supports working with asynchronous data. In the example below, the [`useAsyncList`](/hooks/useAsyncList) hook is used to handle the loading and filtering of data from the server.

<ComponentDemo file="./autocomplete-async.demo.tsx" />
