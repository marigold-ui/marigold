title: Slider
caption: Component to select a value within a range.
---

The `<Slider>` is a form component that allows users to quickly select a value within a range. They should be used when the upper and lower bounds of the range are known and static.

For accessibility reasons you can use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to select a value.

## Import

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Props

<PropsTable componentFile="Slider.tsx" />

## Examples

### Width

Here you can see a `<Slider>` with a smaller width than the default.

<ComponentDemo file="./slider-width.demo.tsx" />

### Disabled

You can also disable the `<Slider>` if you want user not to select a value.

<ComponentDemo file="./slider-disabled.demo.tsx" />

### Step

This example shows how to use the `step` property. The value is set in steps of 10.

<ComponentDemo file="./slider-steps.demo.tsx" />

### Max value

If you want to use a other `maxValue` than 100. You can set the property and change it to the value you want.

<ComponentDemo file="./slider-max.demo.tsx" />

### Value (controlled)

This example shows how to build a controlled `<Slider>`. The `value` prop together with the `onChange` prop are used to update and set the current value. The default value in the example is set to "75", if you manually change the value it will be updated. If you want an uncontrolled `<Slider>` see the next example.

<ComponentDemo file="./slider-controlled.demo.tsx" />

### Default Value (uncontrolled)

If you just set the `defaultValue` property, your `<Slider>` will be uncontrolled. In this case you don't have an `onChange` event. If you want a controlled `<Slider>` see the example above.

<ComponentDemo file="./slider-uncontrolled.demo.tsx" />

### Format Options

In this example you can see which format the `<Slider>` can have. You can use all NumberFormatOptions for that.

<ComponentDemo file="./slider-format.demo.tsx" />
