The `<Slider>` is a form component that allows users to quickly select a value within a range. They should be used when the upper and lower bounds of the range are known and static.
Sliders provide a visual indication of adjustable content, where the user can increase or decrease the value by moving the handle along a horizontal track.

  <SectionMessage.Content>
    For accessibility reasons you can use the left and right arrow keys on your
    keyboard to select a value.

## Anatomy

Sliders consist of a track element showing the range of available values, one or more thumbs showing the current values, an output displaying the current values textually, and an optional label.

The thumbs can be dragged to allow a user to change their value. In addition, the track can be clicked to move the nearest thumb to that position.

## Usage

Sliders allow users to view and select a value (or range) along a track. They’re ideal for adjusting settings such as volume and brightness.

A slider’s `step` size defines the increments at which the slider can move, allowing users to make finer or coarser adjustments based on the context—such as adjusting volume in single steps versus increments of ten. Setting an appropriate step size enhances usability, especially for precise inputs.

The `step` default increment is <strong>1</strong>.

### Label

The label is automatically placed on top of the slider and aligned to its left side. It informs users what value(s) they have selected. You can place it with the `label` prop.

<ComponentDemo file="./slider-do-label.demo.tsx" />

<GuidelineTiles>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Do label the slider appropriately with the value being modified.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
</GuidelineTiles>

### Range slider

The slider can be configured with multiple thumbs to select a range of related values. A common use-case of this component is a price range picker that allows a user to set the minimum and maximum price.

To make it work you need at least to define `defaultValues` (uncontrolled) or `value` (controlled) and for accessibility reasons, you should set the `thumbLabels` prop.

<ComponentDemo file="./slider-range.demo.tsx" />

### Step precision

Selecting a precise value using a slider can be challenging, as it often requires fine motor control, even with a well-designed slider.
When attempting to pick a single, specific value, users may find themselves overshooting or undershooting the target.

<strong>Task</strong>: Try picking a random number on the slider, then attempt
to pick the very next number without using the keyboard for assistance. Take
note of how many attempts it takes to reach that exact number.

This exercise highlights the difficulty in achieving precise control with sliders, especially at smaller increments.
For users, this can become frustrating, particularly in applications where exact values are necessary.
This is why well-considered step sizes and alternative input methods (e.g., `<NumberField>`) are often used alongside sliders to ensure accessibility and ease of use.

<ComponentDemo file="./slider-dont-small-steps.demo.tsx" />

<GuidelineTiles>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      Don't use too small number steps. If picking an exact value is important
      to the goal of the interface, choose an alternate UI element, like
      NumberField or Combobox.
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</GuidelineTiles>

### Value formatting

Values are formatted as a percentage by default, but this can be modified by using the `formatOptions` prop to specify a different format.
`formatOptions` is compatible with the option parameter of [Intl.NumberFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat) and is applied based on the current locale.

<ComponentDemo file="./slider-format.demo.tsx" />

### Form

Sliders can also be used in forms. To access the values of multiple thumbs you have to setup the `thumbLabels` prop.
The default label for a single thumb is <strong>start</strong>.

<ComponentDemo file="./slider-form.demo.tsx" />

### Additional description

Sometimes the label isn't enough for the user. In this case, to gather additional support for the user we can use the help text.
With this we can add helpful hints for the user below the input field. Beside that the help text is placed in close proximity to the associated input field.

<ComponentDemo file="./slider-do-description.demo.tsx" />

### Min and max values

By default, slider values are percentages between 0 and 100. A different scale can be used by setting the `minValue` and `maxValue` props.

<ComponentDemo file="./slider-custom-value-scale.demo.tsx" />

## Props

<StorybookHintMessage component={title} />

<PropsTable component={title} />

## Alternative components

There are alternative UI elements that can be used in place of sliders, depending on the specific use case and design goals. Some alternatives include:

<ul>
  <li>
    [NumberField](/components/form/number-field): Instead of using a slider,
    users can directly input the desired value into a numeric input field. This
    approach provides precise control and is particularly useful when users need
    to input specific or exact values.
  </li>
  <li>
    [Combobox](/components/form/combobox): Can be used to present a predefined
    set of options from which users can choose. This can be a suitable
    alternative when there is a limited range of choices or discrete values to
    select from.
  </li>
</ul>
