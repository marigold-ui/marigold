Buttons are crucial components of any user interface, allowing users to initiate actions such as submitting forms, adding items to a cart, or opening dialogs. The label on a button indicates the action that will be taken when the user presses it.

Different types of buttons, such as primary and secondary, help guide users by visually prioritizing actions. Primary buttons are typically used for the most important actions, while secondary buttons provide less critical options.

## Import

```tsx
import { Button } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Props

<PropsTable component={title} />

## Examples

### Button Variants

Different types of buttons can be utilized through the `variant` prop. Choose the most suitable one based on your context.

<ComponentDemo file="./button-variants.demo.tsx" />

<SectionMessage type="info">
  <SectionMessage.Title>About the "secondary" Variant</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    The core theme does not include a "secondary" button. In the demo above,
    this variant will default to a regular button without any additional
    styling.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

### Full width

The width of buttons automatically adjusts to fit the label. Use the `fullWidth` prop to make the button span the entire available width.

<ComponentDemo file="./button-variants.demo.tsx" />

### Navigation with Buttons

Never use buttons for navigation. Always use links to direct users to a new page. Using buttons for navigation can cause accessibility issues, such as making it difficult for keyboard and screen reader users to interact properly.

The Button component is designed for interactive elements that trigger actions. If you need a link that looks like a button, use the [`<Link>`](/components/content/link) component with the appropriate `variant`.

<ComponentDemo file="./button-link.demo.tsx" />

### Action Buttons

- alignment, secondary + primary
- TODO: Build an example using "actions" in dialog / message? (we actually don't have a good way to add buttons to a message...)

### Full width

- prop `fullWidth`

### Primary Button

The function of the primary `<Button>` is to achieve the most common or most important goal of the user, it has more visual weight than the secondary `<Button>`. There should not be more than one primary `<Button>` in a screen at the time.

<ComponentDemo file="./button-primary.demo.tsx" />

### Secondary Button

The Secondary `<Button>` is an alternative to the user to the primary `<Button>`. They are used for actions like canceling, skipping, resetting, declining an offer etc.

<ComponentDemo file="./button-secondary.demo.tsx" />

### Ghost Button

Ghost `<Button>` are used for miscellaneous actions, they are important but is not the ones where it is desired that the user focus at the moment.

<ComponentDemo file="./button-ghost.demo.tsx" />

### Suplementary Text Button

The only text `<Button>` can be used in a similar way of a secondary `<Button>`, but they are meant to be less relevant to the user. It is also a good way if you want a `<Button>` that don't really look like one.

<ComponentDemo file="./button-text.demo.tsx" />

### Button with Icon

[Icons](/components/icon/) can be added in order to make clear, what a `<Button>` does. Buttons should not be made only with icons, because every user may understand them on a different way. If you want to have simple icon with a [`<Tooltip>`](/components/tooltip/) you can choose a `<Button>` with an icon.

<ComponentDemo file="./button-icon.demo.tsx" />

### Button Sizes

If there are many actions in one page, is it possible to use small buttons instead of big ones. As well if the page is required to be open on mobile devices.
Also there is the `fullWidth` property, with that one you can stretch the width of the `<Button>`.

<ComponentDemo file="./button-size.demo.tsx" />

### Button as a Link

Sometimes you want to use an `<a>` tag, instead of a `<button>`, but you still want it to look and behave like a button. This might be the case when you want the user to enable to download a file that is already available via URL. Instead of loading the file on click, you can make use of the [`[download]` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/download).

To make this possible, Marigold's `<Button>` component allows to change the rendered element by using the `as` prop, similiar to the [`<Box>`](/components/box/#polymorphic-component) component.

<ComponentDemo file="./button-link.demo.tsx" />
