The `<Button>` component is a crucial components of any user interface, allowing users to initiate actions such as submitting forms, adding items to a cart, or opening dialogs. The label on a button indicates the action that will be taken when the user presses it.

Different types of buttons, such as primary and secondary, help guide users by visually prioritizing actions. Primary buttons are typically used for the most important actions, while secondary buttons provide less critical options.

## Anatomy

A button consists of a clickable area, often containing a textual label or icon, which users can click or activate using the Space or Enter keys. For buttons with only an icon and no visible text, it's important to set an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` prop to provide a descriptive label for assistive technologies.

## Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

<SectionMessage variant="info">
  <SectionMessage.Title>About the "secondary" Variant</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    The core theme does not include a "secondary" button. In the demo above,
    this variant will default to a regular button without any additional
    styling.

## Usage

### Visual hierarchy

Only include one primary button in a page or area of the user interface. This primary button should represent the most crucial action within that section. Having multiple primary buttons in one area can create confusion and visual clutter, as they compete for the user's attention and detract from the clarity of the intended action.

### Labels and icons

Buttons should always have a label unless they use an icon that is universally understood and accessible. Icons can accompany the label but should not be purely decorative. Use an icon only when it has a strong association with the label text.

For icon-only buttons, ensure you set an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute to provide context and maintain accessibility.

### Avoid disabled buttons

A disabled button can't be actioned. Keep buttons active and use validation and error messages to guide users on what needs to be done to proceed.

Disabled buttons are problematic as they offer no feedback on why an action is unavailable, are often hard to see due to low contrast, and are inaccessible to keyboard users who cannot focus on them.

In general, it's best to avoid using disabled buttons. However, if they are necessary, take steps to make them more inclusive. Ensure users don't get stuck by providing additional information. Place a message near the disabled button that explains why it is unavailable and what actions are needed to enable it.

<ComponentDemo file="./button-disabled.demo.tsx" />

<SectionMessage variant="warning">
  <SectionMessage.Title>
    Never put tooltips on disabled buttons
  </SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    Tooltips aren't accessible on all devices or by some assistive technologies,
    and they should never be used on non-interactive elements.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

### Full width

Full-width buttons are especially useful for emphasizing primary actions like submitting a form or completing a purchase, as they attract attention and create a strong visual hierarchy. They also enhance usability on mobile devices or in narrow layouts by providing a larger, easier-to-tap target.

### Navigation with buttons

Never use buttons for navigation. Always use the `<Link>` component when navigation to another URL or page. Using buttons for navigation can cause accessibility issues, such as making it difficult for keyboard and screen reader users to interact properly.

In this case the `<Link>` should appear like a button. This is often the case for actions like "Cancel" that redirect users to another page. This approach visually emphasizes the action, making it clear and prominent, while maintaining the accessibility of the app.

If you need a link that looks like a button, use the [`<Link>`](/components/content/link) component with the appropriate `variant`.
