The `<Button>` component is a crucial components of any user interface, allowing users to initiate actions such as submitting forms, adding items to a cart, or opening dialogs. The label on a button indicates the action that will be taken when the user presses it.

Different types of buttons, such as primary and secondary, help guide users by visually prioritizing actions. Primary buttons are typically used for the most important actions, while secondary buttons provide less critical options.

## Anatomy

A button consists of a clickable area, often containing a textual label or icon, which users can click or activate using the Space or Enter keys. For buttons with only an icon and no visible text, it's important to set an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` prop to provide a descriptive label for assistive technologies.

## Appearance

<AppearanceDemo component={title} />

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

<SectionMessage type="info">
  <SectionMessage.Title>About the "secondary" Variant</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    The core theme does not include a "secondary" button. In the demo above,
    this variant will default to a regular button without any additional
    styling.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

## Usage

### With Icons

<ComponentDemo file="./button-icon.demo.tsx" />

### Full Width

The width of buttons automatically adjusts to fit the label. Use the `fullWidth` prop to make the button span the entire available width.

<ComponentDemo file="./button-full-width.demo.tsx" />

### Navigation with Buttons

Never use buttons for navigation. Always use links to direct users to a new page. Using buttons for navigation can cause accessibility issues, such as making it difficult for keyboard and screen reader users to interact properly.

The Button component is designed for interactive elements that trigger actions. If you need a link that looks like a button, use the [`<Link>`](/components/content/link) component with the appropriate `variant`.

<ComponentDemo file="./button-link.demo.tsx" />

### Action Buttons

- alignment, secondary + primary
- TODO: Build an example using "actions" in dialog / message? (we actually don't have a good way to add buttons to a message...)

## Props

<PropsTable component={title} />
