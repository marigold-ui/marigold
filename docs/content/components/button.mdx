The Button component renders a `<button>` element.
Buttons allow users to perform an action.
They have multiple styles for various needs, and are ideal for calling attention to where a user needs to do something in order to move forward in a flow.
The style variant and size of the button can be added with the variant prop and is composed like `variant.size`.

<MarigoldTheme>
  <Inline space="small">
    <Button variant="primary">Primary</Button>
    <Button variant="secondary">Secondary</Button>
    <Button variant="ghost">Ghost</Button>
    <Button variant="text">Text Only</Button>
  </Inline>
</MarigoldTheme>

```tsx onlyCode
import { Button } from '@marigold/components';
```

<Button variant="primary">Primary</Button>
```

#### Disabled

```tsx preview
<Button variant="primary" disabled>
  Primary
</Button>
```

```

### Button with icon

Icons can be added in Order to make clearer what a button does. Buttons should not be made only with icons, because every user may understand them on a different way.

```tsx
<Button variant="primary" space="xxsmall">
  <Ticket /> Icon Primary
</Button>
```

```tsx
<Button variant="primary" space="xxsmall" disabled>
  <Ticket /> Icon Primary
</Button>
```

### Small Buttons

If there are many actions in one page, is it possible to use small buttons instead of big ones. As well if the page is required to be open on mobile devices.

<Button variant="primary" size="small">
  Primary
</Button>
```

```tsx
<Button variant="primary" size="small" disabled>
  Primary
</Button>

<Button variant="secondary" size="small">
  Secondary
</Button>

<Button variant="secondary" size="small" disabled>
  Secondary
</Button>

<Button variant="ghost" size="small">
  Ghost
</Button>

<Button variant="ghost" size="small" disabled>
  Ghost
</Button>
