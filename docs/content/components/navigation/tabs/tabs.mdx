The `<Tabs>` component allows you to organize related content into multiple sections. They allow the user to navigate between groups of information that appear within the same context.

## Anatomy

`<Tabs>` consist of a tab list with one or more visually separated tabs. Each tab has associated content, and only the selected tab's content is shown. Each tab can be clicked, tapped, or navigated to via arrow keys.

<ul>
  <li><b>Tab list:</b> Holds multiple tabs. Use the `<Tabs.List>` component within `<Tabs>` to group tabs that a user
    can switch between.</li>
  <li><b>Tab:</b> Use `<Tabs.Item>` inside `<Tabs.List>` to add a title for an individual item. A tab has a clear
    signifier that marks which tabs is displaying content.</li>
  <li><b>Tab panel:</b> Shows the content to the selected Tab.</li>
</ul>

    `<Tabs>` is a so called <b>compound component</b>. If you don't know what that means or you want to explore more
    about it you find a [tutorial](https://marigold-rapp.vercel.app/compound-component) for this topic in our reference
    app.

## Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Usage

`<Tabs>` are used to organize groups of related content that are at the same level of hierarchy, allowing users to
navigate views without leaving the page.

  <SectionMessage variant="warning">
    <SectionMessage.Title>Important note</SectionMessage.Title>
    <SectionMessage.Content>
      The example show how to connect the `<Tab.List>` item with the `<Tab.Panel>`. It is <b>necessary</b> that both
      components using the same `id`.
    </SectionMessage.Content>
  </SectionMessage>

### Arrangement of tabs

Arrange tab content so high-use content is first in the list and selected by default. This maximizes visibility of
frequently accessed content and lowers its interaction cost.

### Use Descriptive Tab Labels

Users should be able to predict what theyâ€™ll find when selecting a tab. Since unselected tabs conceal their content,
labels with strong information scent are crucial for users to engage with them. Use plain language rather than made-up
marketing terms.

## Alternative components

<ul>
  <li>
    [Accordion](/components/collection/accordion): Accordions are another
    effective method for collapsing content. Accordions can utilize longer
    labels and work well to organize short pieces of content such as FAQs.
  </li>
</ul>
