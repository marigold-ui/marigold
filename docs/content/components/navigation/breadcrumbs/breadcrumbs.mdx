The `<Breadcrumbs>` component allows users to easily understand their current location within a website or app. It shows a sequence of clickable items, each representing a step or level in the hierarchy, making it easier to navigate back to previous pages or sections.

## Anatomy

The `<Breadcrumbs>` component consists of breadcrumb items and separators, such as slashes or chevrons, arranged in a horizontal trail to represent a navigation path.

## Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Usage

`<Breadcrumbs>` are typically used to display a navigational hierarchy, showing the path from the homepage to the current page, with clickable items that allow users to navigate back to previous levels. Breadcrumbs improve user experience by providing quick access to other parts of the website and reducing the number of clicks needed to navigate.

### Links

Breadcrumb items can be interactive links, allowing users to click on previous items in the hierarchy. It's important to set the `href` property for these items to make them navigable.

### Collapsing Breadcrumbs

When the breadcrumb list exceeds the maximum number of visible items, it can collapse to show an ellipsis ("..."). This feature is helpful when dealing with deep navigation structures that may overwhelm the user.
