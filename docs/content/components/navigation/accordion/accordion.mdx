An `<Accordion>` is a component that allows you to organizing content into collapsible sections. Accordions are commonly used in website and application designs to present information in a compact and organized way, allowing users to focus on the specific information they are interested in without being overwhelmed by excessive content.

## Usage

An `<Accordion>` is a UI component that allows users to expand and collapse sections of content. It helps in organizing information efficiently, improving navigation, and reducing visual clutter. Common use cases include FAQs, structured data presentation, and collapsible navigation menus.

While accordions are a great tool for managing content, they are not always the best solution. In cases where users need frequent access to key information, hiding it behind an interaction can create unnecessary friction. Similarly, for long or complex content, expanding a section may lead to overwhelming amounts of text rather than improving readability. Navigation menus with only a few items may not benefit from collapsible sections, as this adds clicks rather than streamlining access. Finally, for processes requiring users to follow a specific sequence, a step-by-step layout is often more effective than collapsible sections.

### Content Organization

Accordions help structure content by breaking it into collapsible sections, making navigation easier while preventing cognitive overload. They are particularly useful when dealing with large amounts of information that do not need to be viewed all at once.

### Using Forms

For complex forms, accordions can group related fields into sections, reducing visual clutter and making the completion process more intuitive. This is particularly beneficial for multi-step or conditional forms where not all fields need to be shown at once.

### Multiselect Accordion

With the multiselection mode you can collapse and hide the items as you want. For sure you can set one or more defaultExpandedKeys.

### Controlled Accordion

A controlled `Accordion` can be expanded and collapsed using expandedKeys and onExpandedChange. The expandedKeys must match the id on the `Accordion.Item` component(s) that you wish to expand.
