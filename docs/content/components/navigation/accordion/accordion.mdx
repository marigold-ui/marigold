Accordions are commonly used in website and application designs to present information in a compact and organized way, allowing users to focus on the specific information they are interested in without being overwhelmed by excessive content.

The `<Accordion.Item>` can be expanded by default using the `defaultExpandedKeys` property or collapsed.
You can also switch the `selectionMode` for `<Accordion>` by passing its property. The default behavior is set to single mode.
