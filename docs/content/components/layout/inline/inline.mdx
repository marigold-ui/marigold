The `<Inline>` component is a responsive layout component based on CSS Flexbox. It aligns its content horizontally in a row and automatically wraps to a new line when there isn't enough space on the screen.

Use the inline component in combination with other layout components to easily [create customized layouts](../../concepts/layouts).

## Usage

If you have more than two elements you can use the `<Inline>` component to arrange elements horizontally according to the space required.
For adding the space between the elements you need to use the `space` property and set it to a supported [space value](../../introduction/design-tokens#spacing).

<ComponentDemo file="./inline-elements.demo.tsx" />

### Different alignment

The child elements can be positioned differently on their x and y axis.
Items of various height can be vertically aligned using the `alignY` prop. In the following example you can see it.

<ComponentDemo file="./inline-alignments.demo.tsx" />

For horizontally alignment you can use the `alignX` prop.

## Props

<PropsTable component={title} />
