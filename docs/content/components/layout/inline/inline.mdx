The `<Inline>` is a responsive layout component. It is based on CSS Flexbox and will be aligned horizontally in a row. It will wrap if there is no more space given on the screen.

## Usage

If you have more than two elements you can use the `<Inline>` component to arrange elements horizontally according to the space required.
For adding the space between the elements you need to use the `space` property and set it to a supported [space value](../../introduction/design-tokens#spacing).

<ComponentDemo file="./inline-elements.demo.tsx" />

### Nested Inline

`<Inline>` components can also have themselves as component. This can be used to add more spacing within the elements.

<ComponentDemo file="./inline-nested.demo.tsx" />

### Different alignment

If elements need to be positioned differently on their x and y axis, this can be done with the `<Inline>` component.
In this case one of the following props is given. Either `alignX` or `alignY`.

<ComponentDemo file="./inline-alignments.demo.tsx" />

## Props

<PropsTable component={title} />
