### More than two elements

If you have more than two elements you can use the `<Inline>` component. The elements are arranged according to the space required.

### Spacing

The `<Inline>` component can be used to add spacing between elements.
For this you need the props `space` and you can then place all components inside the `<Inline>` element.

<ComponentDemo file="./inline-spacing.demo.tsx" />

### Nested Inline

`<Inline>` components can also have themselves as component. This can be used to add more spacing within the elements.

<ComponentDemo file="./inline-nested.demo.tsx" />

If elements need to be positioned differently on their x and y axis, this can be done with the `<Inline>` component.
In this case one of the following props is given. Either `alignX` or `alignY`.
