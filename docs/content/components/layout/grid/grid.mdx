The `<Grid>` component is a versatile tool to arrange child elements (`Grid.Area`) within a two-dimensional grid structure ([CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout)).

## Usage

`<Grid>` allows full control over columns and rows sizes, spacing between children, and the overall height. It is highly customizable, so that the `<Grid>` can be used optimally for complex layouts.

One of the benefits of using `<Grid>` is that its associated components, `<Grid.Area>`, don't need to be arranged in any specific order. They will be automatically positioned based on their `name` prop. If you'd like to understand more about how grid template areas function, you can find a detailed article [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/understanding-css-grid-template-areas/).

### Bento

The `<Grid>` component can also be used to create [bento layouts](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/web-design-trend-bento-box-95814d99ac62). Here is an examples for a more complex grid, where every element has its own dimensions.

## Props

<StorybookHintMessage component={title} />

### Grid

<PropsTable component={title} />

### Grid.Area

<PropsTable component="GridArea" />

## Alternative components

Since the `<Grid>` component should be used when you need to create more complex layouts, the following components can can help you if you need simpler layout structures.

<ul>
  <li>[Tiles](/layout/tiles): With `<Tiles>` you have the possibility to create equal wide elements in a grid system.</li>
  <li>[Column](/layout/grid): If you need to have elements placed in one line.</li>
</ul>
