The `<Aside>` component is a responsive layout element designed for displaying side content next to main content. It ensures the side content has a fixed width while the main content dynamically adjusts to fill the remaining space.

## Usage

Use the `<Aside>` for building layouts were you need to have one dynamic main content with a fixed side content. On smaller screens, e.g. on mobile devices, the content is automatically shifted one below the other when 50% of the width is reached. You can also adjust this by setting the `wrap` property to a percentage value.

<SectionMessage>
<SectionMessage.Title>
Important
</SectionMessage.Title>
<SectionMessage.Content>
The `<Aside>` must have exactly two children, where none is a `<Fragment>`.
</SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

The example shows a simple `<Aside>` component. If you have a look on the code tab you get to know how to set the `side`, `sideWidth` and `space` prop.

Through `space` you can define the gap between the contents.
With `sideWidth` you define the width for the side content and with `side` you define the side on which the side content will appear.
