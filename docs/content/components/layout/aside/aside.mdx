title: Aside
caption: Component to seperate content from the main content.
---

The `<Aside>` is a responsive layout component. It should be used if you want to layout side content next to the main content. The side has a fixed width and the other one(the main content) can have a dynamic width.

If the screen becomes too small for the `<Aside>`, the content will automatically wrap.

It is important to note that the `<Aside>` must have exactly two children, where none is a `<Fragment>`.

## Import

```tsx
import { Aside } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Props

<PropsTable componentFile="Aside.tsx" />

## Examples

### Space between elements

The example shows how the `space` prop is to use. It defines the gap between the contents.
