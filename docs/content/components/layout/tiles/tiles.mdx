The `<Tiles>` component is based on [CSS grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) system. With the grid you have the possibility to create equal wide tiles.

## Usage

`<Tiles>` serves as a versatile container, ideal for constructing panels, cards, lists, and other content components that organize and group information They automatically wraps children to a new line if the space given is not enough to show the `<Tiles>` in one row.

It's possible to display the items with some spacing through `space` prop or set a minimum width for all items inside `<Tiles>` with `tilesWidth` prop.

### Equal heights

The Example shows how to use the `equalHeight` property, which is a boolean value that can be used to size the items of the `<Tiles>`. In this case, all items adopt the size of the largest card, making it essential when you want all items to match the largest childâ€™s dimensions.

<ComponentDemo file="./tiles-autoRows.demo.tsx" />

### Stretch width

Using the `stretch` property will make the tiles fully responsive. Meaning, they will distribute available width between them while not getting smaller then the given `tilesWidth`.

<ComponentDemo file="./tiles-stretch.demo.tsx" />

### Complex tiles example

This is a good example of how to use `<Tiles>` with cards and content.

<ComponentDemo file="./tiles-complex.demo.tsx" />

### Props

<StorybookHintMessage component={title} />

<PropsTable component={title} />

## Alternative components

It should be noted that `<Tiles>` is used for children with the same width.

<ul>
  <li>
    [`<Columns>`](/components/columns/): If you want to set different widths for the children use [`<Columns>`](/components/columns/) instead.
</li>
</ul>
