The `<Tiles>` component is based on [CSS grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) system. With the grid you have the possibility to create equal wide tiles.

## Usage

`<Tiles>` serves as a versatile container, ideal for constructing panels, cards, lists, and other content components that organize and group information.

It's possible to display the children elements with some spacing through `space` prop or set a minimum width for all items inside `<Tiles>` with `tilesWidth` prop.

### Spacing Tiles

An example on how to use the `space` prop. The default is none. You can set it to any value.

<ComponentDemo file="./tiles-spacing.demo.tsx" />

### Tiles with tilesWidth

This Example shows how to use the `tilesWidth` property on `<Tiles>`.

<ComponentDemo file="./tiles-itemwidth.demo.tsx" />

### Tiles with equal Heights

The Example shows how to use the `equalHeight` property, which is a boolean that can be used to size the items of the `<Tiles>`. You can see that all items have the size of the large Pikachu card. It is necessary if you want all items in the largest size of a child.

<ComponentDemo file="./tiles-autoRows.demo.tsx" />

### Tiles with and without stretch

Using the `stretch` property will make the tiles fully responsive. Meaning, they will distribute available width between them while not getting smaller then the given `tilesWidth`,

<ComponentDemo file="./tiles-stretch.demo.tsx" />

### Complexe Tiles with Boxes and Stacks

A full example of a use case with `<Tiles>` and `<Card>` inside it.

<ComponentDemo file="./tiles-complex.demo.tsx" />

### Props

<StorybookHintMessage component={title} />

<PropsTable component={title} />

## Alternative components

It should be noted that `<Tiles>` is used for children with the same width.

<ul>
  <li>
    [`<Columns>`](/components/columns/): If you want to set different widths for the children use [`<Columns>`](/components/columns/) instead.
</li>
</ul>
