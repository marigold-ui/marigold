    The marigold flower, known for its bright orange and yellow hues, is more
    than just a vibrant addition to gardens. Marigolds have been used for
    centuries in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. In
    many cultures, they symbolize positive emotions like warmth and creativity,
    and are often used in festivals and celebrations. The marigold is also known
    for its ability to deter garden pests, making it a favorite companion plant
    for vegetables. Beyond their beauty, these flowers play a role in pollinator
    gardens, attracting bees and butterflies to enhance biodiversity.
