The `<Container>` component is designed to limit the width of its content, ensuring an optimal reading experience. By constraining the content width, it helps maintain readability and prevents text from becoming difficult to follow on wide screens.

## Usage

The `<Container>` component is ideal for situations where you need to limit the width of content to ensure better readability and layout consistency. Here are some common use cases where the `<Container>` component is particularly useful:

- **Text-Centric Pages**: Pages that contain mostly text, such as FAQ pages, user guides, or terms of service, benefit from the `<Container>` component, as it ensures the text is easy to follow and comfortable to read.
- **Hero Sections**: Use the `<Container>` for hero banners with headlines and call-to-action buttons. Limiting the width keeps the focus on the main message, avoiding the visual dispersion that comes with overly wide text blocks.
- **Centering Content**: The `<Container>` is also useful when you need to center content on the page while ensuring it doesn't stretch too far, providing a consistent and polished appearance.

### Content types

The `<Container>` component can switch between different content types via the `contentType` prop. This flexibility is important because regular content (e.g., text) often requires more width for optimal readability compared to shorter content like headlines. Use the correct `contentType` based on the type of content you are displaying to achieve the best reading experience. By default the `<Container>` expects regular text as its content.

### Width and spacing

The `<Container>` component lets you adjust the width of its content using the `containerWidth` prop. This helps to optimally use the available space in a layout.

In addition, the `space` prop can be used to set the amount of whitespace between the items inside the `<Container>`. This is helpful for ensuring the elements have consistent spacing, which makes the layout look clean and easy to use.

<SectionMessage>
  <SectionMessage.Title>Dynamic container sizing</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>The width of the `<Container>` is not fixed but adjusts based on the font size, as the optimal reading length is determined by the number of characters per line. This is why the first paragraph in the demo below is wider than the others.</SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

### Alignment

### Container sizes

In this example the `size` prop is set to small. You can also choose medium or large size. It sets the width of the content of the container.

## Text Container

In some cases, the width of the content can be smaller than the container's width. You can use the `align` prop to align the container left, center or right. The `alignItems` props allows you to align the children left, center or right.
