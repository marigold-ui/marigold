title: Container
caption: Component used to structure the content.

The `<Container>` component is a CSS grid layout component in which you can wrap child components. This component should be used if you want to structure content or form components. It is also useful when you want to use a [`<Breakout>`](/components/breakout/).

`<Container>` width is based on used font and is optimized for readability. You can use `header` or `content` as content type and set the `size` prop to `small`, `medium` or `large`.

It is also possible to set the alignment for the `<Container>` itself and for its children.

## Import

To import the component you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { Container } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Props

<PropsTable component={title} />

## Examples

### Container sizes

In this example the `size` prop is set to small. You can also choose medium or large size. It sets the width of the content of the container.

<ComponentDemo file="./small-container.demo.tsx" />

## Text Container

In some cases, the width of the content can be smaller than the container's width. You can use the `align` prop to align the container left, center or right. The `alignItems` props allows you to align the children left, center or right.

<ComponentDemo file="./full-container.demo.tsx" />
