The `<Breakout>` component is designed to help elements break out of their current grid layout, creating visual interest and giving content the space it needs to stand out.

## Usage

Use the `<Breakout>` component when you need elements to break out of their current grid layout, adding visual interest and giving content the space it needs to stand out.

It is particularly useful for situations where extra emphasis is needed or when you want to create a more dynamic and engaging reading experience. `<Breakout>` is ideal for highlighting media elements or other key content.

Combine `<Breakout>` with the `<Container>` component to maintain a cohesive design while effectively drawing attention to important elements.

### Vertical alignment

In this case the `height` prop is necessary, if you haven't set it, the `alignY` has no impact.

### Horizontal alignment

Example to show how the `alignX` prop is to set. Options are `"left" | "center" | "right"`. The default value is `left`.
