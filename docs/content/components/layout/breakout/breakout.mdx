title: Breakout
caption: Component that breaks out of a grid layout context.
---

`<Breakout>` is a layout component which lets you span the full row in a CSS grid context e.g. our [`<Container>`](container/) component.

You need this component if you want to display something out of the context. It is also possible to put several components into the `<Breakout>`.

You can use `alignX` or `alignY` to place the items inside the `<Breakout>` element.

## Import

```tsx
import { Breakout } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Props

<PropsTable component={title} />

## Examples

### Vertical alignment

In this case the `height` prop is necessary, if you haven't set it, the `alignY` has no impact.

### Horizontal alignment

Example to show how the `alignX` prop is to set. Options are `"left" | "center" | "right"`. The default value is `left`.

<ComponentDemo file="./horizontal-breakout.demo.tsx" />

### Breakout iframe

This example shows how to use an `<iframe>` within a `<Breakout>`.
