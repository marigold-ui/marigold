The `<Stack>` component is a layout component that is there to stack its children. It has a flexbox context similar like the [`<Inline>`](/components/inline/).

The component should be used anywhere were elements are stacked one atop another. It is also possible to nest if needed.

`<Stack>` uses the spaces from the given theme, but you can use [`<Split>`](/components/split/) to add bigger spacing. You can also align the elements horizontal and vertical.

## Usage

### Import

To import the component you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { Stack } from '@marigold/components';
```

### Props

<PropsTable
  props={[
    {
      property: 'space',
      type: 'ResponsiveStyleValue<string>',
      description: 'Space between the elements.',
      default: 'none',
    },
    {
      property: 'alignX',
      type: '`none, left, right, center`',
      description: 'Horizontal alignment for the children',
      default: 'none',
    },
    {
      property: 'alignY',
      type: '`none, top, bottom, center`',
      description: 'Vertical alignement for the children.',
      default: 'none',
    },
    {
      property: 'stretch',
      type: 'boolean',
      description:
        'Stretch to fill space (vertical AND horizontal, useful if you want to change y alignment).',
      default: 'false',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Examples

### Spacing

This example shows how to use the `space` property. You can see the large space between the elements.

<ComponentDemo file="./stack-spacing.demo.tsx" />

### Nested

The `<Stack>` component can also be nested in another `<Stack>`. So you can build complex structures and constructs but without breaking layout.

<ComponentDemo file="./stack-nested.demo.tsx" />

### Horizontal Alignment

The example shows the `alignX` prop, which is used to align the children horizontal. Options are `right`, `center` and `left`. Default is set to `none`.

<ComponentDemo file="./stack-horizontal.demo.tsx" />

### Vertical Alignment

You can use the vertical alignment just with the `stretch` prop when its set to true. The `stretch` property stretches to fill the space of the element. With the vertical align you can align the children on `top`, `center` or `bottom`. Default is set to `none`.

<ComponentDemo file="./stack-vertical.demo.tsx" />
