The `<Stack>` component is a responsive layout component based on [CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox). The stack is basically a flexbox column that acts as a container that aligns its children vertically in new lines. The component should be used anywhere were you need to layout elements stacked one atop another.

Use the stack component in combination with other layout components to easily [create customized layouts](../../concepts/layouts).

## Usage

The use of `<Stack>` is recommended if you have two or more elements that must be the same distance apart. For the space you have to use our supported [space values](../../introduction/design-tokens#spacing).

<ComponentDemo file="./stack-spacing.demo.tsx" />

Together with a [`<Split>`](../layout/split) you can use the `<Stack>` to create as much space as given between two elements while staying in the stack layout.

### Different alignment

Of course you can align the stack vertically and horizontally. This is useful if you need to place certain items at a certain position. For vertical alignment you need to set the `alignY` property and the `stretch` property to true. The `stretch` property stretches the stack to fill the space of the parent element.

With the vertical align you can align the children on `top`, `center` or `bottom`. Default is set to `none`.

<ComponentDemo file="./stack-vertical.demo.tsx" />

For horizontal alignment of the children, the children need to have a defined width given so it can align inside the stack container.

To align the children horizontal you have to use the `alignX` property. Options are `right`, `center` and `left`. Default is set to `none`.

<ComponentDemo file="./stack-horizontal.demo.tsx" />

### Nested stacks

Sometimes you may need complexer layouts to arrange your elements, with the stack component you can also nest stacks within stacks. So you can build complex structures and constructs but without breaking the layout.

<ComponentDemo file="./stack-nested.demo.tsx" />
