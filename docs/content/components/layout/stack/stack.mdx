The `<Stack>` component is a responsive layout component based on [CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox). The stack is basically a flexbox column that acts as a container that aligns its children vertically in new lines. The component should be used wherever you need to arrange elements stacked on top of each other.

Use the stack component in combination with other layout components to easily [create customized layouts](../../foundations/layouts).

## Usage

The use of `<Stack>` is recommended if you have two or more elements that must be the same distance apart. For the space you have to use our supported [space values](../../introduction/design-tokens#spacing).

In this example you can see, the space prop ensures that each child is separated by the same space which maintains visual consistency.

<ComponentDemo file="./stack-spacing.demo.tsx" />

### Different alignment

Of course you can align the elements inside of the stack vertically and horizontally. This is useful if you need to place certain items at a certain position. For vertical alignment you need to set the `alignY` property and the `stretch` property to true. The `stretch` property stretches the stack to fill the space of the parent element.

With the vertical align you can align the children on `top`, `center` or `bottom`.

<ComponentDemo file="./stack-vertical.demo.tsx" />

For horizontal alignment of the children, the children need to have a defined width given so it can align inside the stack container.

To align the children horizontal you have to use the `alignX` property. Options are `right`, `center` and `left`.

<ComponentDemo file="./stack-horizontal.demo.tsx" />

### Nested stacks

Sometimes you may need complexer layouts to arrange your elements, with the stack component you can also nest stacks within stacks. So you can build complex structures and constructs but without breaking the layout.

The following example shows how stacks can be nested within each other. You see how a stack will behave with a [inline](../layout/inline) and [split](../layout/split) component.

<ComponentDemo file="./stack-nested.demo.tsx" />

## Props

<StorybookHintMessage component={title} />

<PropsTable component={title} />

## Alternative components

<ul>
  <li>
    [Inline](../layout/inline): If you need to have the elements displayed in a
    row you should use our inline component.
  </li>
</ul>
