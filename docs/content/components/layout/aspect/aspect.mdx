The `<Aspect>` component keeps media elements like images or videos in their correct aspect ratio, preventing them from looking stretched or squished on different screens. It is particularly useful for creating responsive layouts where consistent media dimensions are important.

## Usage

When using the "aspect" component to maintain the aspect ratio of media elements, choose an appropriate predefined ratio to ensure a consistent and visually appealing layout. The available aspect ratios include:

- **square**: For media that should have equal width and height.
- **landscape**: Suitable for wider-than-tall elements, commonly used for photos and videos.
- **portrait**: Ideal for media taller than they are wide, like profile pictures.
- **widescreen**: Useful for standard video content with a 16:9 ratio.
- **ultrawide**: Best for extra-wide content, such as panoramic media.
- **golden**: Reflects the golden ratio, providing a balanced and aesthetically pleasing aspect.

Select a ratio based on the type of media and the context in which it is displayed to achieve the best visual effect.

### Max Width

Setting a max width is useful when you want to prevent a media element from growing too large, especially on wider screens. It helps maintain a balanced layout by ensuring the media stays within a reasonable size.

The max width can be controlled using the `maxWidth` prop, allowing you to easily set a limit that fits your layout needs.
