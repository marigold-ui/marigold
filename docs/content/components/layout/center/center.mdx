caption: Component to center its children horizontally.
---

The `<Center>` is a layout component that centers its children horizontally.
You can use it to center a single child or a list of children. The `<Center>` component has also the property maxWidth.

The `<Center>` component can also be a child from the [`<Stack>`](/components/stack/) or [`<Inline>`](/components/inline/) component.

## Import

```tsx
import { Center } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Props

<PropsTable componentFile="Center.tsx" />

## Examples

### Center element with maximum width

To center an element you must give the element a `maxWidth` prop.

<ComponentDemo file="./width-center.demo.tsx" />

### Center more than one element with space

To add spaces between each child you can use the prop `space`.

<ComponentDemo file="./space-center.demo.tsx" />

### Center inside Text Block

If you want to center something like a `<Button>` you must only wrap your component with a `<Center>` component.

<ComponentDemo file="./text-center.demo.tsx" />
