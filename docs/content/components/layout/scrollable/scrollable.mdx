title: Scrollable
caption: Lets the content scroll.
---

This component is commonly used in applications to manage large amounts of information or data, providing a convenient way for users to explore content without overwhelming the available screen space. The `children` of the `<Scrollable>` will scroll inside the container.

By default, the `width` is set to 100%, you can change the `width` to get a horizontal scrollbar. Same you can archieve with the `height` property. By default this takes the available height.

## Import

```tsx
import { Scrollable } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Props

<PropsTable
  props={[
    {
      property: 'width',
      type: 'string | number',
      description: `Sets the width of the container. You can see allowed tokens here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/width  `,
      default: 'full',
    },
    {
      property: 'height',
      type: 'string',
      description:
        'Set the height of the container. You can use any pixel value.',
      default: 'not set',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Examples

### Vertical Scrolling

This example shows the `<Scrollable>` container layout with some text inside of it. The `height` is set to `200px` to enable vertical scrolling.

<ComponentDemo file="./scroll-vertical.demo.tsx" />

### Horizontal Scrolling

Otherwise you also have the possibility to scroll horizontal, for that set the `width` prop to another value.

<ComponentDemo file="./scroll-horizontal.demo.tsx" />

### Scrollable Card

If you want to scroll inside some element for example the `<Card>`, you can use also the `<Scrollable>` inside of it.

<ComponentDemo file="./scroll-card.demo.tsx" />

### Scrollable Table Context

The example shows a `<Scrollable>` which contains a `<Table>`. This is a good example of how this layout component should be used.

<ComponentDemo file="./scroll-table.demo.tsx" />
