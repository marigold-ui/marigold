The `<Split>` behaves as an addition to the [`<Inline>`](/components/inline/) and [`<Stack>`](/component/stack/) components. It creates an empty div between two elements with the CSS Flexbox grow class. With that it allows you to split the contents of two elements inside a flex context.

## Usage

Use the `<Split>` whenever you need to divide elements of a stack or inline into two. It can serve as an alternative to two nested stacks or inlines.

You of course can also apply the split in any other flexbox context. But we recommend to use it with our given components.

### With inline

You can see below how to use the `<Split>` within the `<Inline>`.
To use the split with the inline correctly you have to set the inline as parent and add the split between the two elements you want to seperate.
With that you can provide as much space as given between the two children.

<ComponentDemo file="./split-inline.demo.tsx" />

### With stack

The same that goes for the inline is also possible with the stack component. You have to set the split as child inside of the stack between two other children.

<ComponentDemo file="./split-stack.demo.tsx" />

## Props

<StorybookHintMessage component={title} />

<PropsTable component={title} />
