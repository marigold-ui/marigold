Tags help users explore, filter, or manage related options in a compact and accessible format. They are arranged in a container where they can be interacted with as a group. Tag groups are commonly used in search interfaces, content management systems, or anywhere users need to explore, refine, or manage categories and topics.

## Anatomy

A tag group consists of a group label, a field label, individual tags with tag labels, and optional remove buttons for each tag.

## Usage

Tags are best used to help users explore, filter, or manage related options in a clear and compact format. They work well in interfaces where users need to select from a list of categories, refine content through filters, or manage applied labels such as interests, skills, or topics.

Because tags are small, lightweight, and easily scannable, they support quick decision-making and reduce visual noise. Use them when grouping semantically similar items, especially in forms, search experiences, or when summarizing user-defined inputs like selected filters or preferences.

### Content and labeling

Tag labels should be concise, typically under 20 characters, to keep them easily scannable and prevent visual clutter. Keep the total number of tags manageable, generally no more than 8 to 10 at once, to avoid overwhelming users.

Use sentence case and avoid unnecessary words or filler to maintain a consistent and clear labeling style. Each tag should be descriptive and specific to avoid ambiguity and help users quickly understand the meaning or purpose of the tag in context.

### Interactive vs static

Do not use tags to display the status of an object or to highlight new content, use the [badge component](/components/content/badge) instead.

Tags are interactive elements intended for selection, filtering, or removal, whereas badges are static indicators meant to convey status or highlight new or updated items. Use badges when the information should be visible but not acted upon, and tags when the user needs to interact with or manage the content.

## Props

<StorybookHintMessage component={title} />

### Tag

<PropsTable component={title} />

### Tag.Group

<PropsTable component="TagGroup" />

### Tags with a label

In this example we have the `<Tag>` component that has been given the `label`.

<ComponentDemo file="./label-tag.demo.tsx" />

### Removable tags

In this example, the `<Tag>` component receives tags from a dynamic collection and can remove these tags.

<ComponentDemo file="./remove-tag.demo.tsx" />

## Alternative components

<ul>
  <li>
    [Badge](/components/content/badge): Small indicator often used to show a
    status, count, or notification on another UI element. It is not interactive
    like a Tag and used for highlighting statuses.
  </li>
</ul>
