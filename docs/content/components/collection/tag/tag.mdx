A `<Tag>` is a small, interactive element that displays a piece of information, typically formatted as a label or badge, it can indicate to different types, statuses, or categories .

## Anatomy

Tags are comprised of container, text title and dismissable tags include an additional close icon.

<Image
  src="/tag/tag-anatomy.jpg"
  alt="Anatomy of a tag"
  width={800}
  height={550}
  className="mx-auto block"
/>

- **Tag container:** This is primary element that holds content and icons.

- **Tag label:** Short descriptive text describing the tag.

- **Dismiss icon:** Optional icon to close the tag.

## Usage

Tags are components that are often used to label different items, create categorization, filter data, select or deselect options.

### Tag Limitations

Tags should not be used as navigational elements that redirect users to entirely different pages or launch new tabs. They are meant to represent or label content within the current context and should maintain a consistent user experience without disrupting the flow by initiating significant context changes.

### Optimal number of tags

When using tags, itâ€™s important to limit the number to avoid overwhelming the user. A general guideline is to use moderate number of tags in a single group. This ensures clarity and prevents the interface from becoming cluttered, making it easier for users to scan and understand the categorized information.

## Props

<StorybookHintMessage component={title} />

### Tags with a label

In this example we have the `<Tag>` component that has been given the `label`.

<ComponentDemo file="./label-tag.demo.tsx" />

### Removable tags

In this example, the `<Tag>` component receives tags from a dynamic collection and can remove these tags.

<ComponentDemo file="./remove-tag.demo.tsx" />

## Alternative components

Choosing the right alternative to radio buttons is important for providing an optimal user experience, especially when different types of selections are required. Depending on the nature of the choices and the desired interaction, the following components can serve as an alternative to radio buttons:

<ul>
  <li>
    [Badge](/components/content/badge): Small indicator often used to show a
    status, count, or notification on another UI element. It's typically less
    interactive than a Tag and used for highlighting numbers or statuses.
  </li>
</ul>
