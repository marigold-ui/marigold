  height={550}
  className="mx-auto block"
/>

## Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

- **Tag container:** This is the primary element that holds content and icons.

- **Tag label:** Short descriptive text describing the tag.

- **Remove icon:** Optional icon to remove the tag.

## Usage

Tags are components that are often used to label differ`ent items, create categorization, filter data, select or deselect options.

### Optimal number of tags

When using tags, itâ€™s important to limit the number to avoid overwhelming the user. A general guideline is to use up to 10-15 tags in a single group. This ensures clarity and prevents the interface from becoming cluttered, making it easier for users to scan and understand the categorized information.

### Tags with a label

In this example, the `<Tag>` component receives tags from a dynamic collection and can remove these tags.

## Alternative components

Choosing the right alternative to tags is important for providing an optimal user experience, especially when different types of content labeling or categorization are required. Depending on the nature of the content and the desired interaction, the following components can serve as an alternative to tags:

<ul>
  <li>
    [Badge](/components/content/badge): Small indicator often used to show a
    status, count, or notification on another UI element. It's typically less
    interactive than a Tag and used for highlighting numbers or statuses.
  </li>
</ul>
