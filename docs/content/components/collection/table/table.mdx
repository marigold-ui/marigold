The `<Table>` is a structured component used to organize and display tabular data in rows and columns for UI. It enhances the functionality of regular `<table>` elements with the possibility to interact and select the data, and helps with accessibility by enabling keyboard navigation.

<SectionMessage>
  <SectionMessage.Title>What is tabular data?</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    Tabular data is a structured form of data that is organized in rows and
    columns and resembles a table format.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

Our table allows user to selecting one or multiple rows, it includes an action cell, and supports sorting columns. Additionally, it features a sticky header, can stretch to full size, and allows columns to be aligned to the left, center, or right. The table also supports nesting columns and having fixed column widths.

These features will be explained in more detail in the usage section further down the page.

## Anatomy

A table is composed of a container element that organizes data into rows and columns. Each cell within the table can hold either plain text or focusable elements. If the table allows row selection, the first column of each row include a checkbox for selecting that row. Additionally, if the table supports selecting multiple rows, the first column header will contain a "select all" checkbox.

## Usage

Use a `<Table>` if you need to organize and display large amout of data.
Grouping informations provide a structured and organized way to display data, making it easier to understand and analyze.

The table should also be used if you need to compare data, unlike a card, you don't have to move your eyes too much or store information in memory. Also one use case is to provide single or multiple row actions, with that you can deleting, sharing, or performing some other data-specific action.

### Display secondary information

Secondary data in a cell is needed when additional context or details are necessary to fully understand the primary data. The primary data of a table cell should always be displayed clearly. It provides better readability and can improve the user experience. Too much secondary data can overwelm users and make the table complexer and harder to read.

<ComponentDemo
  file="./table-secondary-content.demo.tsx"
  disableLabelWidth="true"
/>

    </Do.Figure>
    <Do.Description>

      needed add related data values in one cell (e.g. username and e-mail).

</GuidelineTiles>

### Sticky header

If you have large data tables, setting the header to sticky can provide context when scrolling. To do this, set the `stickyHeader` property on the `<Table>` and wrap it in the [Scrollable](../layout/scrollable) component with a specified height, as shown in the example below.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-fixed-header.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

### Highlight data

This is an example of how you can use the [`<Badge>`](../content/badge) within the `<Table>`. Badges can be used in a table to highlight or categorize certain data, making it easier for users to quickly identify key information. This is a common use case if you need to add status indicators, categorizations, labels or tags within the table.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-badge.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

<GuidelineTiles>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Place badges consistently within the table, preferably in a dedicated
      column.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      Don't place badges randomly within the table or overload the table with
      too many badges.
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</GuidelineTiles>

### Sorting

Enable the sorting function to help users organize and find data efficiently. This is especially useful since different user tasks may require different sorting orders.

The `<Table>` is sortable through `allowsSorting` prop on it. Sorting controls, indicated by an arrow icon, are located in the column headers and allow for ascending or descending order. For this purpose the properties `onSortChange` which handles the direction when changing and `sortDescriptor`, containing the current column and direction must be specified.

For async sorting you must use the `useAsyncList` hook. The hook manages the async list data and provides convenience methods for updating the data.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-async.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

### Handling numeric values

With our formatting helper components for dates and numeric values you can easily ensure consistent and accurate display. See [NumericFormat](../formatters/numericformat/numericFormat), [DateFormat](../formatters/dateformat/dateFormat) for more informations.

Also you see how to use the `align` property on the columns. With that you can set the content of a column to left, center or right.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-numeric.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

<Do>
  <Do.Description>
    <ul>
      <li>Align quantitive numeric values and header cells to the right.</li>
      <li>
        Use our [formatters](../formatters/numericformat/numericFormat) to
        provide tabular numerics.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Do.Description>
</Do>

### Action cells

Action cells are useful when you need to perform actions. For example, if you need to edit the content of a cell, you can provide an action to open a modal and edit the fields associated with the content.

In this example an [`<ActionMenu>`](../overlay/menu) is used to make interaction possible. The table should only be used with one action cell at the end of the columns and additional with the selection cell with checkboxes at the start of the columns.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-action.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

<GuidelineTiles>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Only use one cell with one action component at the end of the Table to
      call actions.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't use two or more action cells</li>
        <li>Don't write two or more action components in one action cell.</li>
      </ul>
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</GuidelineTiles>

### Nested columns

Nested columns can be useful in tables when you need to organize complex or hierarchical data in a more structured format. These columns can be nested, which will result in more than one header row to be created.

Note the usage of `isRowHeader` in the example below. It controls which columns are included in the [accessibility name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessible_name) for each row. By default, only the first column is included, meaning the aria label will be on the first column only.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-nested.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

<GuidelineTiles>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Keep nested columns simple to avoid overwhelming users with too much
      information at once. Only use one level of nesting.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      Don't use multiple levels of nested columns, this can make the table
      complex and difficult to navigate.
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</GuidelineTiles>

## Props

<SectionMessage>
  <SectionMessage.Title>Hint: Dynamic Collections</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    You don't have to hard code the table items, you could also create a dynamic
    collection and iterate through it. You can read more about these collections
    [here](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/collections.html#dynamic-collections).

## Alternative components

Choosing the right alternative to data tables is crucial for effectively displaying your data and enhancing user interaction. Depending on the type of data and the desired user experience, different components can offer different benefits. Here are some alternatives to data tables that might better suit your needs:

<ul>
  <li>
    [SelectionList](/components/collection/selectlist): Displays a list of
    interactive items, useful to create an actionable list of related items,
    such as a list of users.
  </li>
  <li>
    [Cards](/components/content/card): Helpful if the data needs to be displayed
    with more visual hierarchy. Keep in mind that you can't compare data in this
    way not as good as tables, because the eyes have to move much more.
  </li>
  <li>
    [List](/components/content/list): When presenting a simple, linear
    collection of items, often with less data per item. Easy to read and
    navigate, especially for data that doesn’t require complex organization.
  </li>
  <li>
    [Grid](/components/layout/grid): Layout in a table-like structure. This
    gives you full control over the size of the columns and rows and allows you
    to align them according to your needs.
  </li>
  <li>
    [Columns](/components/layout/columns): Create columns in one row, useful if
    you need to align content in a table-like way with not fewer rows.
  </li>
</ul>
