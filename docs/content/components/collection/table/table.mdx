The `<Table>` is a structured component used to organize and display tabular data in rows and columns for UI. It enhances the functionality of regular `<table>` elements with the possibility to interact and select the data, and helps with accessibility by enabling keyboard navigation.

<SectionMessage>
  <SectionMessage.Title>What is tabular data?</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    Tabular data is a structured form of data that is organized in rows and
    columns and resembles a table format. It is only intended for viewing not
    interacting.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

Our table allows user to selecting one or multiple rows, it includes an action cell, and supports sorting columns. Additionally, it features a sticky header, can stretch to full size, and allows columns to be aligned to the left, center, or right. The table also supports nesting columns and having fixed column widths.

These features will be explained in more detail in the usage section further down the page.

## Anatomy

A table is composed of a container element that organizes data into rows and columns. Each cell within the table can hold either plain text or focusable elements. If the table allows row selection, the first column of each row include a checkbox for selecting that row. Additionally, if the table supports selecting multiple rows, the first column header will contain a "select all" checkbox.

## Usage

### General usage of the component

Use a `<Table>` if you need to organize and display large amout of data. This can be to group informations, compare data or taking actions on single records.

### Applying variant and sizes

Variant and sizes can be applied through properties. You can find all available variants and sizes according to the theme you use in the appearance section. In b2b theme size `compact` for example reduces the cell spacing between the top and bottom. There is also another size, which is called `expanded`, which enlarges the cells.

### Secondary information inside a cell

Secondary data in a cell is needed when additional context or details are necessary to fully understand the primary data. The primary data of a table cell should always be displayed clearly. It provides better readability and can improve the user experience. Too much secondary data can overwelm users and make the table comlpexer and harder to read.

<Columns columns={[1, 1]} space={4}>

    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</Columns>

<ComponentDemo
  file="./table-secondary-content.demo.tsx"
  disableLabelWidth="true"
/>

### Sticky header

If you have large data tables, setting the header to sticky can provide context when scrolling. To do this, set the `stickyHeader` property on the `<Table>` and wrap it in the [Scrollable](../layout/scrollable) component with a specified height, as shown in the example below.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-fixed-header.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

### Highlight data

This is an example of how you can use the [`<Badge>`](../content/badge) within the `<Table>`. Badges can be used in a table to highlight or categorize certain data, making it easier for users to quickly identify key informationa. This is a common use case if you need to add status indicators, categorizations, labels or tags within the table.

<SectionMessage>
  <SectionMessage.Title>Dynamic Collections:</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    You don't have to hard code the table items, you could also create a dynamic
    collection and iterate through it. You can read more about these collections
    [here](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/collections.html#dynamic-collections).
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

<ComponentDemo file="./table-badge.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

<Columns columns={[1, 1]} space={4}>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Place badges consistently within the table, preferably in a dedicated
      column.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      Don't place badges randomly within the table or overload the table with
      too many badges.
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</Columns>

### Sorting

In this example the `<Table>` is sortable through `allowsSorting` prop on it. Sorting controls are located in the column headers and indicated with an arrow icon. The options to sort are ascending or descending. For this purpose the properties `onSortChange` and `sortDescriptor` must be specified.

For async sorting you must use the `useAsyncList` hook. The hook manages the async list data and provides convenience methods for updating the data.

To specify the width of a column you can use the `width` property in the `<Table.Column>` component, this allows you to set a fixed width for a specific columnm ensuring consistent column widths throughout the table.

<Do>
  <Do.Description>
    Enable sorting function to support users organize and find data efficiently,
    especially if different merchant tasks benefit from different sort orders.
  </Do.Description>
</Do>

<ComponentDemo file="./table-async.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

### Action cells and formatters

If you need to edit the table content, you can use a action cell to open a modal and edit the fields related to the content. In this example an `<ActionMenu>` is used to make interaction possible. The table should only be used with one action cell at the end of the columns and additional with the selection cell with checkboxes at the start of the columns.

As you may notice the table below is build with help of our formatting helper components for dates and numeric values. With that you can easily ensure consistent and accurate display. See [NumericFormat](../formatters/numericformat/numericFormat), [DateFormat](../formatters/dateformat/dateFormat) for more informations.

<Do>
  <Do.Description>
    <ul>
      <li>Align quantitive numeric values and header cells to the right.</li>
      <li>
        Use our [formatters](../formatters/numericformat/numericFormat) to
        provide tabular numerics.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Do.Description>
</Do>

<ComponentDemo file="./table-action.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

<Columns columns={[1, 1]} space={4}>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Only use one cell with one action component at the end of the Table to
      call actions.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't use two or more action cells</li>
        <li>Don't write two or more action components in one action cell.</li>
      </ul>
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</Columns>

### Nested Columns

Columns can be nested, which will result in more than one header row to be created. Note the usage of `isRowHeader` in the example below. By default, only the first column is included in the accessibility name for each row.

Also you see how to use the `align` property on the columns. With that you can set the content of a column to left, center or right.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-nested.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

<Columns columns={[1, 1]} space={4}>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Keep nested tables simple to avoid overwhelming users with too much
      information at once.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      Don't use multiple levels of nested tables, this can make the table
      complex and difficult to navigate.
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</Columns>

## Exceptions confirm the rule

If you read so far, you noticed that this use case may not be confirm with the definition of what the `<Table>` should follow. But expecptions prove the rule.

This example below shows how to use input fields within the `<Table>`. For now the Marigold table is only used for presenting data - not interact with certain cells/fields directly, but if you really need input fields in your table you can make this exeption with caution.

<SectionMessage variant="warning">
  <SectionMessage.Title>Avoid mutation</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    It's best practice in React to avoid mutation cause of unpredicatable side
    effects. For more detailed explanations see
    [here](https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state#whats-a-mutation).
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

<p />

<ComponentDemo file="./table-input.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

## Suiteable alternatives

Choosing the right alternative to data tables depends on the type of data you have and how you want users to interact with it.
If you need to create an actionable list of related items, such as a list of users, you can use our [SelectionList](/components/collection/selectlist) component. Alternatively may also a list of [Cards](/components/content/card) work. Lists are helpful if the data is to be displayed more visually and a hierarchy needs to be shown.

The design looks like a table but the content says something different? You should have a look on Marigold's layout components like [Grid](/components/layout/grid) or [Columns](/components/layout/columns). With them you can also create a table-like structure.

Is there still not the right alternative for you please [get in touch](../../introduction/get-in-touch) with us!
