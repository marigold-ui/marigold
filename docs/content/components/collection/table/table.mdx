The `<Table>` component allows to present data in a table format. It enhances the functionality of regular `<table>` elements with the possibility to interact and select the data, as well as, helps with accessibility by providing keyboard navigation.

You can sort with the `<Table>` and add a `selectionMode` property with which you have the possibility to select entire rows.

The component is divided into several parts. So there are the `<Table.Header>`, `<Table.Body>`, `<Table.Column>`, `<Table.Row>` and `<Table.Cell>`.

## Usage

### Import

To import the component you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { Table } from '@marigold/components';
```

### Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

### Props

<PropsTable
  props={[
    {
      property: 'selectionMode',
      type: 'none, single, multiple',
      description: 'The type of selection that is allowed in the collection.',
      default: 'none',
    },
    {
      property: 'onSelectionChange',
      type: '(keys: Selection) => any',
      description: 'Handler that is called when the selection changes.',
      default: 'none',
    },
    {
      property: 'stretch',
      type: 'boolean',
      description: 'Stretch table to fill the container.',
      default: 'false',
    },
    {
      property: 'disabledKeys',
      type: 'Object',
      description: 'Disabled the selected row.',
      default: 'none',
    },
    {
      property: 'sortDescriptor',
      type: 'Object',
      description: 'The current sorted column and direction.',
      default: 'none',
    },
    {
      property: 'onSortChange',
      type: 'function',
      description: 'Handler that is called when the sort direction changes.',
      default: 'none',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Examples

### Compact variant

In this example you can see the variant `compact` from the theme b2b. It reduces the cell spacing. There is also another variant, which is called `expaned`, which enlarges the cells.
The `core-Theme` has also two variants called `tableLines` and `tableBorder`.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-compact.demo.tsx" />

### Selection mode single

If you have set the `selectionMode` to single, then you just can select only one row of the table.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-single-mode.demo.tsx" />

### Selection mode multiple

This example shows how to use the `selectionMode`, but with the setting that multiple checkboxes appear and you can select as many lines as you want.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-multi-mode.demo.tsx" />

### Dynamic collections

You don't have to hard code the table items, you could also create a dynamic collection and iterate through it. That's what the example shows.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-dynamic.demo.tsx" />

### Disabled Rows

You can also disable certain rows. For that all you have to do is add the property `disabledKeys` with the certain key to the table.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-disabled.demo.tsx" />

### Sorting

The options to sort are ascending or descending. For this purpose the properties (`onSortChange`, `sortDescriptor`) for sorting must be specified.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-sorting.demo.tsx" />

### Async sorting

In this example the `<Table>` is also sortable but its build async. For that you must use the `useAsyncList` hook. The hook manages the async list data and provides convenience methods for updating the data.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-async.demo.tsx" />

### Nested Columns

Columns can be nested, which will result in more than one header row to be created. Note the usage of `isRowHeader` in the example below. By default, only the first column is included in the accessibility name for each row.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-nested.demo.tsx" />

### Fixed Column width

In a Table you can specify the width of a column using `width` property in the `Table.Column` component, this allows you to set a fixed width for a specific columnm ensuring consistent column widths throughout the table .

<ComponentDemo file="./table-column-width.demo.tsx" />
