The `<Table>` is a structured component used to organize and display tabular data in rows and columns for UI. It enhances the functionality of regular `<table>` elements with the possibility to interact and select the data, as well as, helps with accessibility by providing keyboard navigation.

<SectionMessage>
  <SectionMessage.Title>What is meant by data?</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    Data refers to static content that is only intended for viewing. Data can
    not be changed inside of the table through input fields. Each row typically
    represents a single record or observation, and each column represents a
    particular attribute or variable of the data.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

Here is a full list of features provided by the `<Table>`:

- Select one or multiple rows
- Action cell
- Allow sorting columns
- Sticky header
- Stretching to full size
- Align columns to left, center or right
- Nesting columns
- Having fixed column widths

These features will be explained in more detail in the usage section further down the page.

## Anatomy

A table is composed of a container element that organizes data into rows and columns. Each cell within the table can hold either plain text or focusable elements. If the table allows row selection, the first column of each row include a checkbox for selecting that row. Additionally, if the table supports selecting multiple rows, the first column header will contain a "select all" checkbox.

## Usage

### General usage of the component

Use a `<Table>` if you need to organize and display large amout of data. This can be to group informations, compare data or taking actions on single records.

<Columns columns={[1, 1]} space={4}>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Provide clear, descriptive column headers that accurately represent the
      data.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      Don't use tables with empty column headers.
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</Columns>

<Columns columns={[1, 1]} space={4}>
  <Do>

        alt="Use tables with clear understandable content"
      />
    </Do.Figure>
    <Do.Description>
      Use full available space given for the table if possible.

        alt="Dont use tables with too much informations inside"
      />
    </Dont.Figure>
    <Dont.Description>
      Don't use tables if there is not enough space on the screen.

        src="/table/table-do-content.jpg"
        alt="Use Table with tabular data"
      />
    </Do.Figure>
    <Do.Description>Only use a table with tabular data.</Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>

  </Dont>
</Columns>

### Applying variant and sizes

Variant and sizes can be applied through properties. You can find all available variants and sizes according to the theme you use in the appearance section. In b2b theme size `compact` for example reduces the cell spacing between the top and bottom. There is also another size, which is called `expanded`, which enlarges the cells.
For the variant, here is `grid` used.

### Visual hierarchy and sticky header

Sometimes the user needs clear visual hierarchy within the table. The main data of a table cell should always be displayed clearly. It provides better readability and can improve the user experience. On the other hand too much visual hierarchy can overwelm users and make the table comlpexer and harder to read.

<Columns columns={[1, 1]} space={4}>
  <Do>
    <Do.Figure>
      <Image
        width={700}
        height={700}
        unoptimized
        src="/table/table-do-hierarchy.jpg"
        alt="Use tables with clear understandable content"
      />
    </Do.Figure>
    <Do.Description>
      Keep cell content concise. Use if possible single lines of text. If needed
      add related data values in one cell (e.g. username and e-mail).
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Figure>
      <Image
        width={700}
        height={700}
        unoptimized
        src="/table/table-dont-hierarchy.jpg"
        alt="Dont use tables with too much informations inside"
      />
    </Dont.Figure>
    <Dont.Description>
      Don't overcrowd cells with too much information or too complex data. Avoid
      adding multiple data values within one cell.
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</Columns>

Sometimes you need to have context given when scrolling down a table. This makes sense for large data tables where it is relevant to know on which column you are.
In this example the header of the table is sticky, for that we have to set the property `stickyHeader` on the `<Table>` and use our [Scollable](../layout/scrollable) component with a certain height, wrapped around it.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-fixed-header.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

### Status indicator

This is a example of how you can use other components like the `<Badge>` within the `<Table>`. This is a common use case if you need to add status indicators to the data.

<SectionMessage>
  <SectionMessage.Title>Good to know:</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    You don't have to hard code the table items, you could also create a dynamic
    collection and iterate through it. That's what the example shows. Also the
    `stretch` property is set to `true`, which allows the table to take the full
    available space. Here you can also see how the selected rows can be read
    out.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

<ComponentDemo file="./table-badge.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

<Columns columns={[1, 1]} space={4}>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Place status badges consistently within the table, preferably in a
      dedicated status column.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      Don't place badges randomly within the table or overload the table with
      too many badges.
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</Columns>

### Async sorting

In this example the `<Table>` is sortable through `allowsSorting` prop on it. Sorting controls are located in the column headers and indicated with an arrow icon.
For async sorting you must use the `useAsyncList` hook. The hook manages the async list data and provides convenience methods for updating the data.

The options to sort are ascending or descending. For this purpose the properties `onSortChange` and `sortDescriptor` must be specified.

To specify the width of a column you can use the `width` property in the `<Table.Column>` component, this allows you to set a fixed width for a specific columnm ensuring consistent column widths throughout the table.

<Do>
  <Do.Description>
    Enable sorting function to support users organize and find data efficiently,
    especially if different merchant tasks benefit from different sort orders.
  </Do.Description>
</Do>

<ComponentDemo file="./table-async.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

### Action cells and formatters

If you need to edit the table content, you can use a action cell to open a modal and edit the fields related to the content. In this example an `<ActionMenu>` is used to make interaction possible. The component should only be used with one action cell at the end of the table and additional with the selection cell with checkboxes at the start of the table.

As you may notice the table below is build with help of our formatting helper components for dates and numeric values. With that you can easily ensure consistent and accurate display. See [NumericFormat](../formatters/numericformat/numericFormat), [DateFormat](../formatters/dateformat/dateFormat) for more informations.

<Do>
  <Do.Description>
    <ul>
      <li>Align quantitive numeric values and header cells to the right.</li>
      <li>
        Use our [formatters](../formatters/numericformat/numericFormat) to
        provide tabular numerics.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Do.Description>
</Do>

<ComponentDemo file="./table-action.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

<Columns columns={[1, 1]} space={4}>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Only use one cell with one action component at the end of the Table to
      call actions.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't use two or more action cells</li>
        <li>Don't write two or more action components in one action cell.</li>
      </ul>
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</Columns>

### Nested Columns

Columns can be nested, which will result in more than one header row to be created. Note the usage of `isRowHeader` in the example below. By default, only the first column is included in the accessibility name for each row.

Also you see how to use the `align` property on the columns.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-nested.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

<Columns columns={[1, 1]} space={4}>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Keep nested tables simple to avoid overwhelming users with too much
      information at once.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      Don't use multiple levels of nested tables, this can make the table
      complex and difficult to navigate.
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</Columns>

## Exceptions confirm the rule

If you read so far, you noticed that this use case may not be confirm with the definition of what the `<Table>` should follow. But expecptions prove the rule.

This example below shows how to use input fields within the `<Table>`. For now the Marigold table is only used for presenting data - not interact with certain cells/fields directly, but if you really need input fields in your table you can make this exeption with caution.

<SectionMessage variant="warning">
  <SectionMessage.Title>Avoid mutation</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    It's best practice in React to avoid mutation cause of unpredicatable side
    effects. For more detailed explanations see
    [here](https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state#whats-a-mutation).
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

<ComponentDemo file="./table-input.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

### Suiteable alternatives

If you need to create an actionable list of related items, such as a list of users, you can use our [SelectionList](/components/collection/selectlist) component.

The design looks like a table but the content says something different? Than you may use a list of [Cards](/components/content/card), a [Grid](/components/layout/grid) or [Columns](/components/layout/columns).

Is there still not the right alternative for you please [get in touch](../../introduction/get-in-touch) with us!
