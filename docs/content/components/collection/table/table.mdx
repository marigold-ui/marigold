The `<Table>` is a structured component used to organize and display tabular data in rows and columns for UI. It enhances the functionality of regular `<table>` elements with the possibility to interact and select the data, and helps with accessibility by enabling keyboard navigation.

<SectionMessage>
  <SectionMessage.Title>What is tabular data?</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    Tabular data is a structured form of data that is organized in rows and
    columns and resembles a table format.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

Our table allows user to selecting one or multiple rows, it includes an action cell, and supports sorting columns. Additionally, it features a sticky header, can stretch to full size, and allows columns to be aligned to the left, center, or right. The table also supports nesting columns and having fixed column widths.

These features will be explained in more detail in the usage section further down the page.

## Anatomy

A table is composed of a container element that organizes data into rows and columns. Each cell within the table can hold either plain text or focusable elements. If the table allows row selection, the first column of each row include a checkbox for selecting that row. Additionally, if the table supports selecting multiple rows, the first column header will contain a "select all" checkbox.

## Usage

### General usage of the component

Use a `<Table>` if you need to organize and display large amout of data. This can be to group informations, compare data or taking actions on single records.

### Secondary information inside a cell

Secondary data in a cell is needed when additional context or details are necessary to fully understand the primary data. The primary data of a table cell should always be displayed clearly. It provides better readability and can improve the user experience. Too much secondary data can overwelm users and make the table complexer and harder to read.

<ComponentDemo
  file="./table-secondary-content.demo.tsx"
  disableLabelWidth="true"
/>

      Don't overcrowd cells with too much information or too complex data. Avoid
      adding multiple data values within one cell.
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</GuidelineTiles>

### Sticky header

If you have large data tables, setting the header to sticky can provide context when scrolling. To do this, set the `stickyHeader` property on the `<Table>` and wrap it in the [Scrollable](../layout/scrollable) component with a specified height, as shown in the example below.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-fixed-header.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

### Highlight data

This is an example of how you can use the [`<Badge>`](../content/badge) within the `<Table>`. Badges can be used in a table to highlight or categorize certain data, making it easier for users to quickly identify key information. This is a common use case if you need to add status indicators, categorizations, labels or tags within the table.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-badge.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

<GuidelineTiles>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Place badges consistently within the table, preferably in a dedicated
      column.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      Don't place badges randomly within the table or overload the table with
      too many badges.
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</GuidelineTiles>

### Sorting

Enable the sorting function to help users organize and find data efficiently. This is especially useful since different user tasks may require different sorting orders.

The `<Table>` is sortable through `allowsSorting` prop on it. Sorting controls, indicated by an arrow icon, are located in the column headers and allow for ascending or descending order. For this purpose the properties `onSortChange` and `sortDescriptor` must be specified.

For async sorting you must use the `useAsyncList` hook. The hook manages the async list data and provides convenience methods for updating the data.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-async.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

### Handling numeric values

With our formatting helper components for dates and numeric values you can easily ensure consistent and accurate display. See [NumericFormat](../formatters/numericformat/numericFormat), [DateFormat](../formatters/dateformat/dateFormat) for more informations.

Also you see how to use the `align` property on the columns. With that you can set the content of a column to left, center or right.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-numeric.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

<Do>
  <Do.Description>
    <ul>
      <li>Align quantitive numeric values and header cells to the right.</li>
      <li>
        Use our [formatters](../formatters/numericformat/numericFormat) to
        provide tabular numerics.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Do.Description>
</Do>

### Action cells

If you need to have actions within the table content, you can use a action cell to open a modal and edit the fields related to the content. In this example an [`<ActionMenu>`](../overlay/menu) is used to make interaction possible. The table should only be used with one action cell at the end of the columns and additional with the selection cell with checkboxes at the start of the columns.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-action.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

<GuidelineTiles>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Only use one cell with one action component at the end of the Table to
      call actions.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't use two or more action cells</li>
        <li>Don't write two or more action components in one action cell.</li>
      </ul>
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</GuidelineTiles>

### Nested Columns

Nested columns can be useful in tables when you need to organize complex or hierarchical data in a more structured format. These columns can be nested, which will result in more than one header row to be created.

Note the usage of `isRowHeader` in the example below. It controls which columns are included in the [accessibility name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessible_name) for each row. By default, only the first column is included, meaning the aria label will be on the first column only.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-nested.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

<GuidelineTiles>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Keep nested columns simple to avoid overwhelming users with too much
      information at once.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      Don't use multiple levels of nested columns, this can make the table
      complex and difficult to navigate.
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</GuidelineTiles>

## Exceptions confirm the rule

If you read so far, you noticed that this use case may not be confirm with the definition of what the `<Table>` should follow. But exceptions prove the rule.

This example below shows how to use input fields within the `<Table>`. For now the Marigold table is only used for presenting data - not interact with certain cells/fields or edit them directly within the table, but if you really need this in your table you can make this exception with caution. It is not recommended to use and might get removed in the future.

## Suitable alternatives

Choosing the right alternative to data tables depends on the type of data you have and how you want users to interact with it.
If you need to create an actionable list of related items, such as a list of users, you can use our [SelectionList](/components/collection/selectlist) component. Alternatively may also a list of [Cards](/components/content/card) work. That is helpful if the data needs to be displayed more visually and a hierarchy should be shown. Keep in mind that you can't compare lists as good as tables.

The design looks like a table but the content says something different? You should have a look on Marigold's layout components like [Grid](/components/layout/grid) or [Columns](/components/layout/columns). With them you can also create a table-like structure.

Is there still not the right alternative for you please [get in touch](../../introduction/get-in-touch) with us!

  <SectionMessage.Title>Hint: Dynamic Collections</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    You don't have to hard code the table items, you could also create a dynamic
    collection and iterate through it. You can read more about these collections
    [here](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/collections.html#dynamic-collections).
