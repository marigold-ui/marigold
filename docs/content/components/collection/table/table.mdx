The `<Table>` is a structured component used to organize and display tabular data in rows and columns for UI. It enhances the functionality of regular `<table>` elements with the possibility to interact and select the data, as well as, helps with accessibility by providing keyboard navigation.

<SectionMessage>
  <SectionMessage.Title>What is meant by data?</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    Data refers to static content that is only intended for viewing. Data can
    not be changed inside of the table through input fields. Each row typically
    represents a single record or observation, and each column represents a
    particular attribute or variable of the data.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

Here is a full list of features provided by the `<Table>`:

- Select one or multiple rows
- Action cell
- Allow sorting columns
- Sticky header
- Stretching to full size
- Align columns to left, center or right
- Nesting columns
- Having fixed column widths

These features will be explained in more detail in the examples further down the page.

### Anatomy

A table is composed of a container element that organizes data into rows and columns. Each cell within the table can hold either plain text or focusable elements. If the table allows row selection, the first column of each row include a checkbox for selecting that row. Additionally, if the table supports selecting multiple rows, the first column header will contain a "select all" checkbox.

## Import

```tsx
import { Table } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Usage

### When to use?

Use a `<Table>` if you need to organize and display large amout of data. This can be to group informations, compare data or taking actions on single records.
Use the `<Table>` when you need to organize and display large amout of data.

### When not to use?

Don't use the `<Table>` if you need to display complex data or if too many interactions are required within the table. The component should only be used with one action cell at the end of the table and additional with the selection cell with checkboxes at the start of the table.

DO AND DONT ACTION CELL

Also the component should not be used for layouting. If you need to layout something which needs a table-like look please visit our layout components like [Grid](/components/layout/grid) or [Columns](/components/layout/columns).

DO AND DONT FOR NOT USE AS LAYOUT

NOT USE TABLE FOR VISUAL PRESANTATION (no big images inside etc)

NOT USE TABLE WIeTH EMPTY HEADERS

NOT USE LIKE event parking conf (use next line), tables dont have labels

## Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

## Props

### Table

<PropsTable component={title} />

### Table.Header

<PropsTable component="TableHeader" />

### Table.Column

<PropsTable component="TableColumnHeader" />

### Table.Body

<PropsTable component="TableBody" />

### Table.Row

<PropsTable component="TableRow" />

### Table.Cell

<PropsTable component="TableCell" />

## Usage

### Applying variant and sizes

In this example you can see the size `compact` from the theme b2b. It reduces the cell spacing. There is also another size, which is called `expanded`, which enlarges the cells.
For the variant, here is `grid` used. You can find all available variants and sizes according to the theme you use in the appearance section.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-compact.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

### Dynamic collections

You don't have to hard code the table items like in the example above, you could also create a dynamic collection and iterate through it. That's what the example shows. Also the `stretch` property is set to `true`, which allows the table to take the full available space. Here you can also see how the selected rows can be read out.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-dynamic.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

### Async sorting

In this example the `<Table>` is sortable through `allowsSorting` prop on it. Sorting controls are located in the column headers and indicated with an arrow icon.
For async sorting you must use the `useAsyncList` hook. The hook manages the async list data and provides convenience methods for updating the data.

The options to sort are ascending or descending. For this purpose the properties `onSortChange` and `sortDescriptor` must be specified.

To specify the width of a column you can use the `width` property in the `<Table.Column>` component, this allows you to set a fixed width for a specific columnm ensuring consistent column widths throughout the table.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-async.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

### Nested Columns

Columns can be nested, which will result in more than one header row to be created. Note the usage of `isRowHeader` in the example below. By default, only the first column is included in the accessibility name for each row.

Also you see how to use the `align` property on the columns.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-nested.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

### Action cells and formatters

If you need to edit the table content, you can use a action cell to open a modal and edit the fields related to the content. In this example an `<ActionMenu>` is used to make interaction possible.

As you may notice the table below is build with help of our formatting helper components for dates and numeric values. With that you can easily ensure consistent and accurate display. See [NumericFormat](../formatters/numericformat/numericFormat), [DateFormat](../formatters/dateformat/dateFormat) for more informations.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-action.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

DO AND DONT ONLY USE ONE ACTION CELL

DO AND DONT FORMATTER ALIGN NUMBERS RIGHT

### Sticky header

In this example the header of the table is sticky, for that we have to set the property `stickyHeader` on the `<Table>` and use our [Scollable](../layout/scrollable) component with a certain height, wrapped around it. When scrolling the context is still given. This makes sense for large data tables where it is relevant to know on which column you are.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-fixed-header.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

### Status indicator

This is a example of how you can use other components like the `<Badge>` within the `<Table>`. This is a common use case if you need to add status indicators to the data.

<ComponentDemo file="./table-badge.demo.tsx" disableLabelWidth="true" />

## Exceptions confirm the rule

If you read so far, you noticed that this example may not be confirm with the definition of what the `<Table>` should follow. But expecptions prove the rule.

This example shows how to use input fields within the `<Table>`. For now the Marigold table is only used for presenting data - not interact with certain cells/fields directly, but if you really need input fields in your table you can make this exeption with caution.

This is a case you normally should avoid. Find another solution that fits better for your use cases. If you need help finding alternatives please [contact us](../introduction/get-in-touch).
