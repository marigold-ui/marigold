The `<Table>` is a structured component used to organize and display tabular data in rows and columns. Built on [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Table.html), it enhances the functionality of regular `<table>` elements with the possibility to interact and select the data, and helps with accessibility by enabling keyboard navigation.

<SectionMessage>
  <SectionMessage.Title>What is tabular data?</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    Tabular data is a structured form of data that is organized in rows and
    columns and resembles a table format.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

The `<Table>` allows selecting one or multiple rows, includes support for row actions, and supports sorting columns. Additionally, it features a sticky header, resizable columns, column alignment, nested columns, fixed column widths, drag and drop reordering, and control over cell content overflow.

These features will be explained in more detail in the usage section further down the page.

## Anatomy

A table view is composed of a container element that organizes data into rows and columns. Each cell within the table can hold either plain text or focusable elements. If the table allows multiple row selection, the first column of each row includes a checkbox for selecting that row and the first column header will contain a "select all" checkbox.

## Usage

Use a `<Table>` if you need to organize and display large amounts of data.
Grouping information provides a structured and organized way to display data, making it easier to understand and analyze.
Tables allow you to group related information in a clear and concise manner, which enhances data readability and comprehension.

They are ideal for comparing data points. Unlike cards, tables enable users to compare multiple rows and columns without having to move their eyes too much or rely on memory.
Also with the support of single or multiple row actions, they make it convenient to perform data-specific actions such as deleting, sharing, or editing records directly within the table.

### Variants

<ul>
  <li>
    **Default:** You should use the default variant of the Table component when
    you want a clean, standard table appearance. It's ideal for most use cases
    where you want to display tabular data clearly and simply. The default
    variant is a good starting point for most tables.
  </li>
  <li>
    **Muted:** Use the `muted` variant for table to reduce visual noise and
    improve clarity, especially in tables with extensive content. This helps
    users focus on the data while maintaining a clean and organized appearance.
  </li>
  <li>
    **Grid:** The `grid` variant is useful if you want clearer separation
    between columns, especially for tables with many columns or dense data. The
    grid variant adds vertical borders between columns, making it easier to scan
    and compare values across rows.
  </li>
  <li>
    **Admin- and Master:** Use this variant to identify rows that are only
    relevant for internal users. [Learn more about its
    usage.](/patterns/admin-master-mark)
  </li>
</ul>

### Display secondary information

Secondary data in a cell is needed when additional context or details are necessary to fully understand the primary data. The primary data of a table cell should always be displayed clearly. It provides better readability and can improve the user experience. Too much secondary data can overwhelm users and make the table more complex and harder to read.

### Sticky header

If you have large data tables, setting the header to sticky can provide context when scrolling. To do this, set the `sticky` property on `<Table.Header>` and wrap it in the [Scrollable](../layout/scrollable) component with a specified height, as shown in the example below.

<ComponentDemo file="./tableview-fixed-header.demo.tsx" />

### Highlight data

This is an example of how you can use the [`<Badge>`](../content/badge) within the `<Table>`. Badges can be used in a table to highlight or categorize certain data, making it easier for users to quickly identify key information. This is a common use case if you need to add status indicators, categorizations, labels or tags within the table.

<ComponentDemo file="./tableview-badge.demo.tsx" />

<GuidelineTiles>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Place badges consistently within the table, preferably in a dedicated
      column.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      Don't place badges randomly within the table or overload the table with
      too many badges.
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</GuidelineTiles>

### Sorting

Enable the sorting function to help users organize and find data efficiently. This is especially useful since different user tasks may require different sorting orders.

The `<Table>` is sortable through `allowsSorting` prop on its columns. Sorting controls, indicated by an arrow icon, are located in the column headers and allow for ascending or descending order. For this purpose the properties `onSortChange` which handles the direction when changing and `sortDescriptor`, containing the current column and direction must be specified.

<ComponentDemo file="./tableview-sorting.demo.tsx" />

### Handling numeric values

With our formatting helper components for dates and numeric values you can easily ensure consistent and accurate display. See [NumericFormat](../formatters/numericformat), [DateFormat](../formatters/dateformat) for more information.

Also you see how to use the `align` property on the columns. With that you can set the content of a column to left, center or right.

<ComponentDemo file="./tableview-numeric.demo.tsx" />

<Do>
  <Do.Description>
    <ul>
      <li>Align numeric values and their header cells to the right.</li>
      <li>Format numbers to provide tabular numeric font style.</li>
    </ul>
  </Do.Description>
</Do>

### Column widths and overflow

The `<Table>` supports setting `width` and `minWidth` on columns to control the layout. Combined with the `overflow` prop on the table, you can control how cell content behaves when it doesn't fit. Set `overflow="truncate"` to clip content with an ellipsis, or use the default `"wrap"` to let text wrap to multiple lines.

<ComponentDemo file="./tableview-overflow.demo.tsx" />

### Row Actions

Row actions let users interact with individual records directly from a table, such as editing, viewing details, or triggering specific operations. Use the `<Button>` component with the secondary (default) variant for row actions. If the action is destructive, use the destructive variant instead. In both cases, apply the small button size to maintain visual consistency.

Always position row actions at the end of the row. This improves scannability and clearly signals which parts of the row are interactive.

<ComponentDemo file="./tableview-action.demo.tsx" />

Show only the most important 1-3 actions per row. If you need to support more than three actions, display the most critical ones directly, and group the rest into a contextual menu using an `<ActionMenu>` (see [ActionMenu section](/components/overlay/menu#actionmenu)).

<ComponentDemo file="./tableview-action-menu.demo.tsx" />

### Links

Inline links for actions can sometimes be mistaken for regular content and may add visual noise, so it's best to use them with care. A common and appropriate use of links in tables is placing one on the identifying attribute of a record, such as a name or title, when it leads to the related item or detail view.

<ComponentDemo file="./tableview-links.demo.tsx" />

### Text selection

By default, clicking on cell text in a `<Table>` with selection enabled will select the row instead of the text. If you need users to be able to copy text from cells, set the `allowTextSelection` prop.

<ComponentDemo file="./tableview-text-selection.demo.tsx" />

## Alternative components

<ul>
  <li>
    [SelectionList](/components/collection/selectlist): Displays a list of
    interactive items, useful to create an actionable list of related items,
    such as a list of users.
  </li>
  <li>
    [Cards](/components/content/card): Helpful if the data needs to be displayed
    with more visual hierarchy. Keep in mind that you can't compare data in this
    way not as good as tables, because the eyes have to move much more.
  </li>
  <li>
    [List](/components/content/list): When presenting a simple, linear
    collection of items, often with less data per item. Easy to read and
    navigate, especially for data that doesn't require complex organization.
  </li>
</ul>
