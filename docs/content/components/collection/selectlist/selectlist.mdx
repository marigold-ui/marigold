The `<SelectList>` component displays a list of items that users can select. It supports both single and multiple selection modes, making it ideal for scenarios where users need to choose from a set of options.

Built on React Aria Components, it provides full keyboard navigation and screen reader support, ensuring an accessible experience for all users.

## Usage

Use `<SelectList>` when you need to present users with a set of options to choose from. It works well for configuration settings, filter selections, item management interfaces, and any scenario requiring user choice from a predefined set.

The component is particularly effective when options need descriptive text or visual elements to help users make informed decisions. For simple form inputs with fewer options, consider using [`<Select>`](/components/form/select/) or [`<RadioGroup>`](/components/form/radiogroup/) instead.

<GuidelineTiles>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Use clear, descriptive labels that help users understand each option.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Do>
    <Do.Description>
      Provide visual hierarchy with images and descriptions when options benefit
      from additional context.
    </Do.Description>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      Don't use generic labels like "Item 1" or "Option A" that don't convey
      meaning.
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
  <Dont>
    <Dont.Description>
      Don't overload items with too much information—keep labels concise and use
      descriptions for details.
    </Dont.Description>
  </Dont>
</GuidelineTiles>

### SelectList with descriptions

Add descriptions to provide additional context for each option. This helps users make informed decisions when selecting items.

<ComponentDemo file="./selectlist-with-description.demo.tsx" />

### SelectList with images

Use `<SelectList.Image>` to add visual elements to your list items. Images help users quickly identify options and create a more engaging interface.

<ComponentDemo file="./selectlist-with-images.demo.tsx" />

### Multiple selection mode

Use multiple selection when users need to choose several related items at once, such as selecting multiple event categories for notifications or filtering by multiple criteria. Set `selectionMode="multiple"` to allow users to select multiple items—checkboxes appear automatically, making it clear that multiple selections are possible.

<ComponentDemo file="./selectlist-multiple-selection.demo.tsx" />

### SelectList with actions

Add interactive actions to items using `<SelectList.Action>`. This is useful for providing item-specific operations like viewing details, editing, or deleting.

Actions remain accessible even when items are disabled, allowing users to perform operations without requiring selection.

<ComponentDemo file="./selectlist-with-action.demo.tsx" />

<SectionMessage variant="info">
  <SectionMessage.Title>Actions vs Selection</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    Use `<SelectList.Action>` for item-specific operations that don't require
    the item to be selected. For bulk operations on selected items, place
    actions outside the list.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>

### Disabled items

Disable items when they're temporarily unavailable or when users don't have the required permissions. Keeping disabled items visible helps users see the full range of options, even if they can't select them right now.

<ComponentDemo file="./selectlist-disabled-items.demo.tsx" />

## Accessibility

The `<SelectList>` component is built with accessibility in mind:

**Keyboard Navigation:**

- **Tab:** Move focus in and out of the list
- **Arrow Up/Down:** Navigate between items
- **Space:** Toggle selection of the focused item
- **Enter:** Activate the focused item's default action
- **Home/End:** Jump to first/last item

**Screen Reader Support:**

- Proper ARIA roles (`grid`, `row`) for list structure
- Selection state announced with `aria-selected`
- Disabled state announced with `aria-disabled`
- Item counts and position information

<SectionMessage variant="info">
  <SectionMessage.Title>Accessible Labels</SectionMessage.Title>
  <SectionMessage.Content>
    Always provide an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to describe the purpose
    of the list. Each item should have a `textValue` to ensure proper screen
    reader announcements.
  </SectionMessage.Content>
</SectionMessage>
