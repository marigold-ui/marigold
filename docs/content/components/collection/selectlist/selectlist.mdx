The `SelectList` can be used to select multiple items from a list simultaneously. It provides a familiar interface where users can select multiple items.

## Anatomy

A `SelectList` consists of a container element, with rows of data inside. The rows within a list may contain focusable elements or plain text content. If the list supports row selection, each row includes a selection indicator.

## Usage

The `SelectList` component is used to display a list of items that can be selected by the user. It supports both single and multiple selection modes, allowing users to choose one or more items from the list.

It's also ideal for displaying lists that can be filtered or sorted. Built with accessibility in mind, it supports full keyboard navigation, making it easy to interact with using only the keyboard.

### SelectList with multiple selection mode

If you want to allow users to select multiple items, you can set the `selectionMode` prop to `multiple`. This enables checkboxes for each item, allowing users to select or deselect multiple items at once.

You can also provide interactive actions for each item, such as buttons or links, to perform specific actions on the selected items.

## Alternative components

The `SelectList` is a versatile component that can be used in various scenarios where users need to select multiple items from a list. But there are alternative components that might be more suitable depending on your specific use case:

- **Table**: If you need to display tabular data with multiple selection capabilities, consider using the `<Table>` component. It provides a structured layout for displaying data in rows and columns, along with selection features.
- **Stack**: If you need to display a list of items with a more compact layout, consider using the `<Stack>` component. It allows you to create a vertical stack of items, which can be useful for displaying lists with less emphasis on selection.
