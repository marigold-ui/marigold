An `<Accordion>` is a component that allows you to organizing content into collapsible sections. It consists of a series of vertically stacked items. Accordions are commonly used in website and application designs to present information in a compact and organized way, allowing users to focus on the specific information they are interested in without being overwhelmed by excessive content.

The `<Accordion.Item>` can be expanded by default using the `defaultExpandedKeys` property or collapsed.
You can also switch the `selectionMode` for `<Accordion>` by passing its property. The default behavior is set to single mode.

## Examples

### Singleselect Accordion

This component shows how a single selection `<Accordion>` is working. It is possible to have just one item open and the other ones hidden. You can also see that the items are fullwidth, which is true by default. Notice that you can't expand two or more items per default.

### Multiselect Accordion

With the multiselection mode you can collapse and hide the items as you want. For sure you can set one or more defaultExpandedKeys.
