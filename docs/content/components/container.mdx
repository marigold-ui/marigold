# Container

Containers width is based on used font and is optimized for readability. You can use `header` or `content` as content type and set the `size` prop to `small`, `medium` or `large`.

<Box border="1px solid #ced4da" bg="#e9ecef" p="xsmall">
  <Box
    as={Container}
    contentType="header"
    align="center"
    alignContainer="center"
  >
    <Headline level="2">Container header</Headline>
  </Box>
  <Box as={Container} align="center" alignContainer="center">
    <Text>
      The container content is for example a long text to present information.
      In this case it is an unnecessary text that is only used to fill the width
      of the container content. Thank you for reading this.
    </Text>
  </Box>
</Box>

```tsx onlyCode
import { Container } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Text Container

In some cases, the width of the content can be smaller than the container's width. You can use the align prop to align the content left, center or right.

```tsx
<Box
  as={Container}
  bg="blue10"
  align="center"
  alignContainer="center"
  p="small"
>
  <Headline level="2">Star Wars - The Empire Strikes Back</Headline>
  <Box pt="xsmall" width="100%">
    <Text>
      It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Although the Death Star has been
      destroyed, Imperial troops have driven the Rebel forces from their hidden
      base and pursued them across the galaxy. Evading the dreaded Imperial
      Starfleet, a group of freedom fighters led by Luke Skywalker has
      established a new secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth. The evil
      lord Darth Vader, obsessed with finding young Skywalker, has dispatched
      thousands of remote probes into the far reaches of space....
