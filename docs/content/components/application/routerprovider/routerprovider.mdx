The [`<RouterProvider>`](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/routing.html) is a component from `react-aria-components` which we expose to give you something on the hand to handle your routes in your application.
It can be used to handle your routes if you use Next.js or the React Router.

## Usage

### Import

To import the component you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { RouterProvider } from '@marigold/components';
```

### Props

<PropsTable
  props={[
    {
      property: 'children',
      type: 'ReactNode',
      default: 'none',
      description: 'The children of the component.',
    },
    {
      property: 'navigate',
      type: '(path: string) => void',
      default: 'none',
      description: 'Set the recived paths where you want to navigate.',
    },

]}
/>

## Examples

### React Router

You can use the provider with the `useNavigate` hook from `react-router-dom`. The outcome from the function you can pass into the `navigate` prop from the `<RouterProvider>`.

If you want to read more about it visit react arias documentation about it [here](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/routing.html#react-router).

### Next.js

Similar to React Router you can pass in the `navigate` prop the routes you get from the `useRouter` hook.

Also for more information please visit react arias documentation about it [here](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/routing.html#nextjs).
