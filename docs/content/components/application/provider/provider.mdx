The `MarigoldProvider` component serves as the wrapper for any application that integrates with Marigold. It is responsible for managing and distributing critical application-level settings, including providing theming to all child components.

By wrapping an app in `MarigoldProvider`, developers can ensure that a consistent theme and other globally relevant configurations are propagated throughout the app's component tree.

## Appearance

The MarigoldProvider component does not have its own visual appearance. However, it hosts the root styles of a theme, ensuring that global styles and theming are applied across the entire app.

## Usage

### Provider with Button

The example shows how the `<MarigoldProvider>` works. As simple as it is you just have to wrap the component around the provider and import a theme. You can click on the theme select on top of the page to see how the `<Button>` changes its theme.

```tsx
import { Button, MarigoldProvider } from '@marigold/components';

<MarigoldProvider theme={theme}>
  <Button variant="primary">Hello World!</Button>
</MarigoldProvider>;
```

## Props

<StorybookHintMessage component={title} />

<PropsTable component={title} />
