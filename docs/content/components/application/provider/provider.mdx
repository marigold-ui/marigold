`<MarigoldProvider>` is the container for all Marigold applications. It defines the theme and other application level settings.
Without the `<MarigoldProvider>` you can't get the theme on your components. So it is necessary to use.

You just have to wrap your components around the `<MarigoldProvider>` to make it work.
If you want to get more information about the setup go to [Getting Started](/introduction/getting-started/#bootstrapping).

```tsx
import { Button, MarigoldProvider } from '@marigold/components';

<MarigoldProvider theme={theme}>
  <Button variant="primary">Hello World!</Button>
</MarigoldProvider>;
```

## Import

```tsx
import { MarigoldProvider } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Props

<PropsTable componentFile="MarigoldProvider.tsx" />

## Examples

### Provider with Button

The example shows how the `<MarigoldProvider>` works. As simple as it is you just have to wrap the component around the provider and import a theme. You can click on the theme select on top of the page to see how the `<Button>` changes its theme.

```tsx
import { Button, MarigoldProvider } from '@marigold/components';

<MarigoldProvider theme={theme}>
  <Button variant="primary">Hello World!</Button>
</MarigoldProvider>;
```
