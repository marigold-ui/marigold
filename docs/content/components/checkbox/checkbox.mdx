The `<Checkbox>` component allows users to select one or more options from a set of options. In order to group multiple checkboxes, use the `<CheckboxGroup>` component.

There are several props for the `<Checkbox>` and the `<CheckboxGroup>`.

You don't have to click on the `<Checkbox>` itself, you can also just click on the label next to the box.
