With `<NumericFormat>` helper, you can easily ensure that numeric values are displayed consistently and accurately, taking into account factors such as decimal separators, currency symbols, and grouping separators specific to each language.

The `<NumericFormat>` component is built on top of the [Intl.NumberFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat) API, which provides comprehensive support for formatting numbers according to locale-specific conventions.

## Usage

Use `<NumericFormat>` when you want to display numeric values like currencies, percentages, or large numbers in a way that automatically adapts to the user's locale and language preferences. It is particularly useful for presenting read-only values in UI components such as tables, cards, and labels.

There is no need to use `<NumericFormat>` with input components like [NumberField](/components/form/number-field), as they already include their own built-in number formatting and parsing behavior.

### Customization Options

You can customize how numbers are displayed by passing any [Intl.NumberFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat) options directly as props to `<NumericFormat>`. This includes settings like how many decimal places to show, whether to format values as currency or percentages, and how to abbreviate large numbers.

You can mix and match these options to match your needs. For a full list of available options, see the [Intl.NumberFormat documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat).
