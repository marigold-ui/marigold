# Breakout

## Description

Breakout is a Layout element which lets you span the full row in a CSS grid context e.g. our Container component. You can use `horizontalAlign` or `verticalAlign` to place the items inside the Breakout element.

<Container alignContainer="center">
  <Box border="1px solid #ced4da" bg="#e9ecef" height="80px" width="100%" />
  <Breakout>
    <Box
      as={Breakout}
      verticalAlign="center"
      horizontalAlign="center"
      border="1px solid #ced4da"
      bg="#e9ecef"
      height="80px"
    >
      BREAKOUT
    </Box>
  </Breakout>
  <Box border="1px solid #ced4da" bg="#e9ecef" height="80px" width="100%" />
</Container>
<br />

```tsx onlyCode
import { Breakout } from '@marigold/components';
```

## Breakout Text inside Container

```tsx
<Container size="large" alignContainer="center">
  <Box as={Text} pb="medium">
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
    1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
    make a type specimen book.
  </Box>
  <Box as={Breakout} verticalAlign="left" css={{ fontWeight: 800 }}>
    IMPORTANT: This is a breakout text inside a container full of random text.
    Aligned from left to write and more width than the maximum width of the
    container.
  </Box>
  <Box as={Text} pt="medium">
    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
    typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
    1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
    including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
  </Box>
</Container>
```
