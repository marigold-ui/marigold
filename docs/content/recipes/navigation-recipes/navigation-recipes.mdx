This pattern recipe might help you building your top navigation for Reservix Applications. It's a pattern that is used by all new Reservix Applications build with Marigold.

## Example

Here you can see how a top navigation can be build with our components. Keep in mind this is only the desktop version and will not work on mobile view.

We used for the layouts the [`<Inline>`](/components/layout/inline/) and [`<Split>`](/components/layout/split/) component.
And because we currently don't have a navigation component we build it with `<div>` and `<a>` elements.

To get the logout button, you have to use the `@marigold/icon` package to get the icon and wrap a [`<Button>`](/components/form/button/) with text variant around it.
