caption: Here you can find some recipes for some form components

We used for these examples form components like `<FieldGroup>`, [`<TextField>`](/components/text-field/),[`<Select>`](/components/select/), [`<Checkbox>`](/components/checkbox/) and [`<Radio>`](/components/radio/).

`<FieldGroup>` is wrapped around the other components as you can see in the examples below. With its prop `labelWidth` we set the width of the label to a certain amount, so it has a clean look.
