# Scripts

We use several scripts to make developing Marigold easier and more convenient.

Run `$ yarn <script name>` in your favorite terminal.

## Developing

### `start`

Boot up [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to maintain or develop new components or themes. This tool is especially useful to debug or make visual changes, check if a11y rules are satisfied or make interactive [play](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/play-function) examples.

### `test (-w)`

Run the test suite. If you append `-w` the suite will run in watch mode, meaning test that are affacted by your changes will be automatically re-run.

### `docs`

Boot up the documentation website. This is helpful if you're writing or editing any documentation. Changes will be automatically detected and force a rebuild of the docs without you having to refresh the page in a browser.

### `coverage`

Same as `test` but will output a coverage report into your terminal.

### `lint`

Run [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/) to check if source files adhere our lint standards. We basically using [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/)'s rules which are very lax and won't unnecessarily annoy you.

### `format`

Run [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) and format source files. We don't care how our source code is formated as long everyone uses the same format.

### `typecheck`

Run the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) compiler to find any inconsistent or wrong types.

## Build

### `build`

Build all the packages.

### `watch`

Build all the packages and rebuild them if any of their source files change.

## Release

If you want to know how to release Marigold, go to the [Release](./release) page.

### `release`

Run our release script to create a new release and deploy the documentation.

### `release:docs`

Deploy documentation.

### `changeset`

Use changeset, see [CLI options](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/command-line-options.md) for more information.

## Troubleshoot

### `clean`

Sometimes node modules have hick ups. This command will remove all `node_module` and build folders so that you have a clean repo like you just git cloned it.

### `clean:build`

Same as `clean` except it will only remove all build folders.

### `postinstall`

You don't ever have to run this is script. Basically, it will remove typings of toolings we use that uses an old version of emotion which causes loads of false-positive type errors in your project.
