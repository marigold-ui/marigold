Space is the invisible structure of our interface. It isn't just empty pixels to be filled, but active connectivity that dictates the hierarchy and logic of a page. The fundamental principle is that the distance between elements directly signals the strength of their relationship, meaning the stronger the bond (like a label and an input), the closer they must be.

To ensure consistency, this system relies on a _relational scale_ of semantic tokens rather than arbitrary pixel values. By decoupling spacing from hard-coded numbers, we allow the interface to adapt gracefully across different contexts and density settings.
