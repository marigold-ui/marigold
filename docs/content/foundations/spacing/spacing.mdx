Space is the invisible structure of our interface. It isn't just empty pixels to be filled, but active connectivity that dictates the hierarchy and logic of a page. The fundamental principle is that the distance between elements directly signals the strength of their relationship, meaning the stronger the bond (like a label and an input), the closer they must be.

To ensure consistency, this system relies on a _relational scale_ of semantic tokens rather than arbitrary pixel values. By decoupling spacing from hard-coded numbers, we allow the interface to adapt gracefully across different contexts and density settings.

## Space communicates relationship

We utilize a relational scale rather than a purely size-based system. While traditional T-shirt sizing (sm, md, or lg) is useful for general dimensions, a relational approach better captures the cognitive connection between objects.

The tokens in the spacing scale describe the strength of the bond between elements rather than size references. In traditional systems, spacing involves a translation step: identifying the relationship ("these items should look like a pair") and then recalling the specific pixel value that represents it.

Using a relational system removes that translation step. When you choose a token, you are not asking "How big should this gap be?" You are asking "How closely related are these two elements?"

> The fundamental rule: The tighter the space, the stronger the relationship.

## Scale

By naming tokens after the relationship (e.g., related, peer), we embed design logic directly into the code. You don't need to memorize the pixel value of "related". You simply identify that a label and input are related to each other, and the system handles the math.

The scale consists of 7 tokens, where each maps to a specific intent. This granular approach ensures that every spacing decision, from the smallest micro interaction border to the largest page level break, follows a consistent vertical and horizontal rhythm.

      <Table.Cell>
        Refers to packed containers side-by-side without any wasted space, like
        a dense list of data cells or entries in a table. It communicates
        high-density scanning where maximum information is prioritized over
        breathing room.

      <Table.Cell>
        This is the minimal unit of separation needed to acknowledge two
        elements are distinct. The small gap communicates that they form a
        single conceptual pair or thought, such as a label and its input field.

      <Table.Cell>**Peer**</Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The wider, balanced space indicates two individual, self-contained
        elements standing as equals (Peers) within the same content flow. This
        is the page's standard reading rhythm.

      <Table.Cell>**Group**</Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The substantial gap signifies logical separation or a change in zone.
        This is the level of space needed to clearly divide major content
        containers like a billing address section from a shipping address
        section.

      <Table.Cell>**Section**</Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        Defines distinct sections of the layout structure. Creates necessary
        breathing room between primary areas like the main content and a
        sidebar, keeping them separate yet part of the same view.

      <Table.Cell>**Context**</Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        Signifies a complete change in context or environment. Acts as a
        narrative break that allows the user to mentally reset before engaging
        with a new theme, such as moving from feature content to the footer.

## Flow

Spacing is applied differently depending on the direction of content flow. Every interface layout is a composition of elements stacking, sitting inline, or containing other elements. Identifying the Axis of Flow ensures we apply the relational scale in a way that respects the component's internal logic.

### Stack (Vertical flow)

The stack axis manages vertical rhythm, addressing how elements pile on top of one another down the page (Y-axis). This flow separates vertical siblings—like a label sitting above an input or paragraphs in an article.

<ComponentDemo file="./spacing-stack.demo.tsx" mode="preview" />

### Inline (Horizontal flow)

The inline axis governs the horizontal association of elements, managing how peers sit side-by-side (X-axis). This context determines the separation between horizontal siblings, such as buttons in a toolbar or an icon next to text.

<ComponentDemo file="./spacing-inline.demo.tsx" mode="preview" />

### Inset (Internal container flow)

The inset axis controls the internal "breathing room" of a container, pushing inward to frame content rather than pushing outward against neighbors. Unlike the stack or inline axes which manage relationships between siblings, inset defines the relationship between a parent container and its children.

While a standard "square inset" applies equal padding on all sides for cards and panels, specific contexts require optical correction. A "squish inset" reduces vertical padding to balance elements like buttons that would otherwise look awkwardly tall, whereas a "stretch inset" reduces horizontal padding to maximize screen real estate in narrow columns or mobile views.

<ComponentDemo file="./spacing-inset.demo.tsx" mode="preview" />

// TODO: add scale here? (something like in order to make it more convenient to apply inset ...)

### Grid (Two-directional flow)

The grid axis handles the macro-layout skeleton where items flow in both X and Y directions simultaneously. This two-directional structure defines the gutters in complex layouts like dashboard masonry or image galleries, establishing a consistent rhythm across the entire 2-dimensional plane.

<ComponentDemo file="./spacing-grid.demo.tsx" mode="preview" />

## Application

Spacing is contextual, not absolute. It is local and relative, meaning the spatial distribution of elements is determined solely by the immediate container they inhabit, rather than a global page layout.

In this system, spatial relationships are self-contained. A specific spacing token, such as "group", retains its semantic meaning regardless of where it appears in the hierarchy. Whether separating small elements inside a card or separating large cards on a dashboard, the relationship ("these items are grouped together") remains consistent, and thus the spacing token remains the same. This eliminates the need to arbitrarily increase spacing values just because an element is higher up in the page structure.

### No global frame of reference

You do not need to escalate the spacing scale simply because you are moving "up" the hierarchy of the application. The token choice is determined by the local relationship of the elements, regardless of where that relationship lives on the screen.

### Recursion in practice

It is common, and encouraged, for the same spacing token (e.g., group) to be used at multiple levels of nesting.

1. **Form Level:** Inside a form, you might use peer to separate inputs and group to separate the Personal Info fieldset from the Address fieldset.
2. **Card Level:** That form lives inside a Card. The Card acts as a new "local" universe.
3. **Page Level:** Several Cards are arranged on a dashboard. You might use group again to separate the Cards from each other.

Even though the Cards are "larger" conceptual objects than the fieldsets, the relationship between two Cards (distinct groups of information) is conceptually similar to the relationship between two fieldsets. Therefore, the same token applies.
