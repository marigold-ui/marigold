Space is the invisible structure of our interface. It isn't just empty pixels to be filled, but active connectivity that dictates the hierarchy and logic of a page. The fundamental principle is that the distance between elements directly signals the strength of their relationship, meaning the stronger the bond (like a label and an input), the closer they must be.

To ensure consistency, this system relies on a _relational scale_ of semantic tokens rather than arbitrary pixel values. By decoupling spacing from hard-coded numbers, we allow the interface to adapt gracefully across different contexts and density settings.

## Space = Relationship

We utilize a relational scale rather than a purely size-based system. While traditional T-shirt sizing (sm, md, or lg) is useful for general dimensions, a relational approach better captures the cognitive connection between objects.

The tokens in the spacing scale describe the strength of the bond between elements rather than size references. In traditional systems, spacing involves a translation step: identifying the relationship ("these items should look like a pair") and then recalling the specific pixel value that represents it.

Using a relational system removes that translation step. When you choose a token, you are not asking "How big should this gap be?" You are asking "How closely related are these two elements?"

By naming tokens after the relationship (e.g., related, peer), we embed design logic directly into the code. You don't need to memorize the pixel value of "related". You simply identify that a label and input are related to each other, and the system handles the math.

**The fundamental principle**

- **High relatedness** = Less space (Elements function as a unit).
- **Low Relatedness** = More Space (Elements are independent ideas).
