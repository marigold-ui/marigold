Space is the invisible structure of our interface. In the Marigold Design System, we do not treat space as "empty pixels" to be filled, but as **active connectivity** between elements.

This system moves away from arbitrary T-shirt sizes (sm, md, lg) and component-specific names (card-padding). Instead, we use a **Relational Scale** that describes the cognitive connection between objects.

## **The Philosophy: Space = Relationship**

When you choose a spacing token, you are not asking _"How big should this gap be?"_ You are asking _"How closely related are these two elements?"_

- **High Relatedness** = **Less Space** (They function as a unit).
- **Low Relatedness** = **More Space** (They are independent ideas).

This approach creates self-documenting code and design specs. A token named stack-related explicitly tells the next developer that these two items belong together, regardless of the specific pixel value.

## **The Relational Scale**

Our scale consists of 7 semantic tokens. Each token has a specific intent and maps to a fluid value that adapts based on the user's **Density Preference** (Cozy vs. Compact).

| Token Name     | Semantic Intent (The "Why")                                                                                | Mental Model           | Cozy (Default) | Compact (Density) |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------- | :---------------- |
| **1. Joined**  | **Fusion.** Elements are structurally fused or touching. They function as a single interactive object.     | \`\` (Border)          | 2px            | \`1px\`           |
| **2. Tight**   | **High Density.** Distinct items packed for scanning efficiency. Used for data-heavy lists or tables.      | \`\[ \]\[ \]\` (List)  | \`4px\`        | \`2px\`           |
| **3. Related** | **Connection.** Elements form a single thought or pair. Use for Label+Input or Icon+Text.                  | \`\[ \] \[ \]\` (Pair) | \`8px\`        | \`4px\`           |
| **4. Normal**  | **Standard Flow.** The default rhythm between independent items. Use for form rows, paragraphs, and cards. | \`\[ \] \[ \]\` (Item) | \`16px\`       | \`12px\`          |
| **5. Group**   | **Containment.** Separation between logical groups. Use to separate Fieldsets, Cards, or Widgets.          | \`\[ \] \[ \]\` (Zone) | \`32px\`       | \`24px\`          |
| **6. Region**  | **Architecture.** Major structural boundaries within a view. Use for Sidebar vs Content.                   | \`\[ \] \[ \]\`        | \`48px\`       | \`32px\`          |
| **7. Section** | **Narrative Break.** Complete context switch. Use for separating major page themes.                        | \`\[ \] \[ \]\`        | \`80px\`       | \`64px\`          |

### **Understanding Density Modes**

Marigold supports high-density data entry contexts without requiring code changes.

- **Cozy (Default):** Optimized for readability, touch targets, and scanning comfort.
- **Compact Mode:** Optimized for "power users," data grids, and complex forms.
- _Behavior:_ When data-density="compact" is applied to a container, all tokens automatically shift down the scale (e.g., Normal shrinks from 16px to 12px).

---

## **Functional Contexts**

To ensure the correct CSS properties are used, we apply the relational scale through four specific contexts.

### **1. Stack (Vertical Flow)**

Controls vertical rhythm (margin-bottom, gap-y, space-y).

- **Usage:** "How much space between this row and the next?"
- **Key Tokens:**
  - stack-related: The glue between a Label and its Input.
  - stack-normal: The standard rhythm of a form (between rows).
  - stack-group: The separation between "Shipping" and "Billing" sections.

### **2. Inline (Horizontal Peers)**

Controls horizontal association (margin-inline, gap-x, space-x).

- **Usage:** "How much space between these buttons?"
- **Key Tokens:**
  - inline-tight: Gap between an icon and text inside a button.
  - inline-related: Gap between "Cancel" and "Save" buttons.
  - inline-normal: Gap between columns in a grid layout.

### **3. Inset (Container Padding)**

Controls internal breathing room (padding).

- **Square Insets:** Equal padding on all sides. Used for Cards, Modals, and Panels.
  - _Example:_ inset-normal (16px all around).
- **Squish Insets:** Asymmetrical padding where the vertical space is **50%** of the horizontal space. This is critical for interactive elements like buttons and inputs to look optically balanced.
  - _Example:_ inset-squish-normal (8px top/bottom, 16px left/right).

### **4. Grid (Layout Structure)**

Controls the macro-layout skeleton (grid-gap).

- **Usage:** Defining the gutters of a dashboard masonry layout.
- **Key Tokens:** grid-normal (16px), grid-group (32px).

## **Decision Tree: How to Choose**

If you are unsure which token to use, follow this logic:

1. **Are the elements touching or fused?** (e.g., Segmented Control)
   - Yes $\\rightarrow$ **Joined**
2. **Are they part of a high-density list or data table?**
   - Yes $\\rightarrow$ **Tight**
3. **Are they a direct pair, like a Label \+ Input?**
   - Yes $\\rightarrow$ **Related**
4. **Are they standard independent items, like Form Rows or Paragraphs?**
   - Yes $\\rightarrow$ **Normal** (This is your default\!)
5. **Are you separating two different Cards or Fieldsets?**
   - Yes $\\rightarrow$ **Group**
6. **Are you separating the Header from the Body content?**
   - Yes $\\rightarrow$ **Region**

---

## **Usage Guidelines**

### **✅ Do**

- **Do** use stack-related for elements that _must_ be read together (Label \+ Value).
- **Do** use inset-squish variants for any element that behaves like a button or input field.
- **Do** rely on the **Compact Mode** toggle to increase density, rather than manually picking smaller tokens.

### **❌ Don't**

- **Don't** use stack-normal (16px) to separate a Label from its Input; they will feel disconnected. Use stack-related.
- **Don't** mix and match arbitrary pixel values (e.g., p-\[14px\]). Always use the semantic scale.
- **Don't** use Group spacing inside a Card; it breaks the container's cohesion.

## **Developer Implementation (Tailwind v4)**

We expose these tokens as Tailwind utility classes mapped to our CSS variables.

```html
<div class="p-inset-normal rounded-lg border bg-white">
  <div class="gap-inline-related mb-stack-normal flex items-center">
    <div class="size-10 bg-gray-100" />
    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Account Settings</h3>
  </div>

  <form class="gap-stack-normal flex flex-col">
    <div>
      <label class="mb-stack-related block text-sm font-medium">Email</label>
      <input type="email" class="p-inset-squish-normal w-full rounded border" />
    </div>

    <div class="gap-inline-related mt-stack-group flex justify-end">
      <button class="p-inset-squish-normal">Cancel</button>
      <button class="p-inset-squish-normal bg-blue-600 text-white">Save</button>
    </div>
  </form>
</div>
```
