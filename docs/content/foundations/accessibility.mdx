## What is Accessibility?

Accessibility means making websites and apps easy for everyone to use, including people with disabilities. Disabilities can affect how someone sees, hears, or interacts with an app. The goal is to remove barriers, so everyone has the same access to content and features.

Here are the main areas to focus on:

- **Perceivability**: Make sure everyone can see and use the content (like adding alt text for images and using readable colors).
- **Operability**: Ensure the app works with different ways of navigating, like using a keyboard instead of a mouse.
- **Understandability**: Keep content clear and easy to follow, with simple layouts and helpful error messages.
- **Robustness**: Design your app to work across devices and assistive tools by using proper HTML and ARIA labels.

Keeping these points in mind makes your app more inclusive and user-friendly for everyone!
