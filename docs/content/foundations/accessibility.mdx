Delivering valuable, inspirational, and accessible experiences for all users, including those with disabilities, is everyoneâ€™s responsibility. We are committed to creating products where no one is left behind or faces a confusing or exclusionary experience. We continually iterate on Marigold to provide you with built-in accessibility features across our components, foundations, guidelines, and tooling.

However, how you use Marigold also affects the accessibility of a product. Read this page to learn about accessibility in general. Then, while you're working, use the accessibility guidelines for each component to help you make products that anyone can use.

## What is accessibility?

Accessibility means making websites and apps easy for everyone to use, including people with disabilities. Disabilities can affect how someone sees, hears, or interacts with an app. The goal is to remove barriers, so everyone has the same access to content and features.

Here are the main areas to focus on:

### Perceivability

Make sure everyone can perceive and understand the content on your app. This includes providing alt text for images so that users who are visually impaired can understand the image content through screen readers.

Additionally, ensure color contrast is high enough to be readable by those with low vision or color blindness. For example, avoid light text on light backgrounds and provide text alternatives for multimedia content like video captions for users who are deaf or hard of hearing.

### Operability

Ensure the app can be navigated and used in different ways. This means making sure users can operate your app with a keyboard instead of a mouse, which is essential for people with mobility impairments who may not be able to use a traditional pointing device. For example, make sure all interactive elements like buttons and links are reachable via keyboard tabbing, and allow sufficient time for users to complete tasks without being timed out.

### Understandability

Keep your content and interface clear and easy to navigate. Use simple, concise language to ensure that users of all literacy levels can understand the information effortlessly. Consistent navigation patterns and predictable interactions help users feel confident while using your app.

Additionally, provide helpful error messages that guide users in fixing mistakes, rather than displaying confusing or vague alerts. For instance, if a user misses a required form field, clearly identify which field needs correction and offer specific instructions on how to address the issue.

### Robustness

Ensure your app is compatible across a wide range of devices, browsers, and assistive technologies. This involves using semantic HTML and ARIA labels correctly to help assistive technologies like screen readers interpret your content accurately. For example, use headings in a logical order to structure content hierarchically, and ensure that form inputs are properly labeled so that screen readers can identify them for visually impaired users.

Keeping these points in mind makes your app more inclusive and user-friendly for everyone!

## Creating accessible apps

Thanks to React Aria, Marigold components come with built-in accessibility features, and we provide guidelines in the component documentation to help you follow best practices. However, it's important to remember that ensuring accessibility compliance when using Marigold components is a team effort. Accessibility is a shared responsibility, and everyone plays a part in making products inclusive for all.
