## What is Accessibility?

Accessibility refers to designing and developing websites, web applications, and digital tools in a way that ensures they can be used by _everyone_, including people with disabilities. Disabilities may affect a person's ability to perceive, understand, navigate, or interact with digital interfaces. In the context of web apps, accessibility is about removing barriers for users with visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, and other impairments, ensuring that they have equal access to content and functionality.

Key areas for accessibility in web apps are:

- **Perceivability**: Ensure content is visible and usable for all users, including those with visual impairments (e.g., providing alt text and high contrast).
- **Operability**: Make sure web apps are navigable via various input methods, like keyboards, with clear focus indicators.
- **Understandability**: Ensure content is easy to understand and interfaces are intuitive, using consistent layouts and clear error messages.
- **Robustness**: Design apps to work across a range of devices and assistive technologies using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
