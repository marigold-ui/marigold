Design tokens are the foundational elements of our design system, defining key aspects of our product's visual language. They enable consistency and flexibility, allowing us to maintain a unified look and feel across all user interfaces.

## Colors

Our color tokens are organized by their functional role, making it easy to apply the right color for backgrounds, text, borders, and more. This structured approach not only maintains a consistent and recognizable palette but also supports dynamic theming and customization.

If you are not sure which token to use, please visit our [design token guideline page](/getting-started/design-token-guidelines).

## Typography

With a defined font family and various font sizes and weights, our typography maintains readability and hierarchy. The consistent use of typography contributes to a polished and cohesive user experience.
For formatting dates or numbers we already have some helper components: [NumericFormat](../components/formatters/numericformat), [DateFormat](../components/formatters/dateformat).

The `Value` corresponds to the class name from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-size).

### Headlines

The `<Headline>` component supports by default certain styles. They are listed as [Tailwind class names](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-size) (font size, weight, and line height).

## Spacing

Consistent spacing ensures harmonious layouts and enhances visual flow. The defined spacing scale helps create balanced and accessible interfaces across different screen sizes. It's used for `gap`, `padding`, `width` and `margin`.

Besides this there are percentage values available for `width` property, which is found in form components. You can use them similar to the tokens above. Here is a list of the values: [Tailwind percentage tokens](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/width#percentage-widths)

## Radius

Standardized border radius contribute to a clean and modern design. These properties are applied to components, ensuring a cohesive appearance throughout our product.

Consistent alignment ensures that elements are arranged in a purposeful manner, enhancing clarity and user comprehension.
