caption: Helpers to make work with Marigold easier.

We have a few helper features that you can use to make your work with Marigold more convenient. They are essential in programming because they simplify complex tasks, promote code reusability, and enhance code readability by breaking down intricate operations into manageable, reusable components.

## cn function

To combine Tailwind CSS classes with other classes, utilize the `cn` function within the className attribute to merge them seamlessly. The inputs of the `className` accept nearly every type. The function itself uses `tailwind-merge` which is a utility function to easily merge the given tailwind classes. We also use `cx` function from [cva](https://cva.style/docs/api-reference), which combines the class names together. You can pass in arrays, boolean conditions, strings or numbers.

### Import

To import the function you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { cn } from '@marigold/system';
```

### Examples

In this example you can see how to use the `cn` function on a `<div>` element. Here are written down some Tailwind CSS class names which will be merged with the ones before. So in the end the class names will be rendered (if `myValue` will be true) as `className='flex flex-col cursor-pointer p-4'`

```tsx
const myOtherValue = 'p-4'
...
<div
  className={cn(
    'flex flex-col p-3',
    myValue ? 'cursor-pointer' : 'cursor-not-allowed',
    myOtherValue
  )}
/>
```

In this code you can see that `p-3` will be overwritten by `p-4`, so keep in mind the order of your class names.

## cva function

To write our styles for a component we use [cva](https://cva.style/docs). This library comes with a great utility function which we use to write styles for our components.
If you want to style your own component you can use this function which we updated with some additional style checks.

### Import

To import the function you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { cva } from '@marigold/system';
```

### Examples

This example shows how to use the function inside a `div` element. You can add some variants and sizes if you want.
