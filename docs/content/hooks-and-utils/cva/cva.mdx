To write our styles for a component we use [cva](https://cva.style/docs). This library comes with a great utility function which we use to write styles for our components.
If you want to style your own component you can use this function which we updated with some additional style checks, for example it resolves conflicts in class names with `tailwind-merge`. With this the class names will be merged together.

### Import

To import the function you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { cva } from '@marigold/system';
```

### Examples

This example shows how to use the function inside a `div` element. You can add some variants and sizes if you want.
