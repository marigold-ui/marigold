# Switch

_Component that switches between two states._

The `<Switch>` component allows the users to select between two states, e.g. on and off.\
It consists of a visual selection indicator and a label.

Users may click or touch a Switch to toggle the state, or use the tab key to navigate to it and the space key to toggle it.

## Anatomy

The styles are separated into some parts (container, label, thumb, track) that you can style in a custom variant.

## Appearance

This component has multiple appearance variants and sizes available.

| Property  | Type | Description                                 |
| :-------- | :--- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `variant` | `-`  | `The available variants of this component.` |
| `size`    | `-`  | `The available sizes of this component.`    |

## Usage

Switches are best used to adjust settings and other standalone options. They make a binary selection, like on and off or true and false.

The effects of a switch should start immediately, without needing to save.

✓ Immediately activate or deactivate something.

✗ Avoid using a switch to select multiple options that require people to save. Switches should be immediate.

✗ Avoid using switches to toggle between opposing options.
