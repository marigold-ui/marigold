## How we work 💻

As we want to avoid working through huge piles of tasks with no end in sight and just solving problems one after the other, we decided to work in 8-week cycles.

#### Development in 6-week phases
We want to use our full focus on one task and not rush through a jungle of issues without knowing when the project ends.
This is why we invest six full weeks into a few tasks each. Like this, we can spend our time individually and really look into a topic for a good amount of time.

#### Planning in 2-week phases
After our 6-week development cycle, we come to the planning phase. We look through our issues and discuss our topics, so that we can finish this phase with a meeting to set the topics of our next development cycle.
