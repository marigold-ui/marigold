      The marigold flower, known for its bright orange and yellow hues, is more
      than just a vibrant addition to gardens. Marigolds have been used for
      centuries in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties.
      In many cultures, they symbolize positive emotions like warmth and
      creativity, and are often used in festivals and celebrations. The marigold
      is also known for its ability to deter garden pests, making it a favorite
      companion plant for vegetables. Beyond their beauty, these flowers play a
      role in pollinator gardens, attracting bees and butterflies to enhance
      biodiversity.
