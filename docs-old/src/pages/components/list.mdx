caption: Component for unordered or ordered list.
---

The `<List>` component is used to display an unordered or ordered list.

The list is divided into two parts: `<List>` and `<List.Item>`.
By default, the application displays an unordered `(ul)` list. However, this list can also be displayed as an ordered `(ol)` list.

The `<List.Items>` in unordered lists are marked with bullets and in an ordered list are marked with numbers.
