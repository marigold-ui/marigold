The `<Table>` component allows to present data in a table format. It enhances the functionality of regular `<table>` elements with the possibility to interact and select the data, as well as, helps with accessibility by providing keyboard navigation.

The component is divided into several parts. So there are the `<Table.Header>`, `<Table.Body>`, `<Table.Column>`, `<Table.Row>` and `<Table.Cell>`.

  <BasicTable />

## Usage

### Import

To import the component you just have to use this code below.

```tsx
import { Table } from '@marigold/components';
```

### Appearance

<AppearanceTable component={title} />

### Props

<PropsTable
  props={[
    {
      property: 'selectionMode',
      type: 'none, single, multiple',
      description: 'The type of selection that is allowed in the collection.',
      default: 'none',
    },
    {
      property: 'onSelectionChange',
      type: '(keys: Selection) => any',
      description: 'Handler that is called when the selection changes.',
      default: 'none',
    },
    {
      property: 'stretch',
      type: 'boolean',
      description: 'Stretch table to fill the container.',
      default: 'false',
    },
    {
      property: 'disabledKeys',
      type: 'Object',
      description: 'Disabled the selected row.',
      default: 'none',
    },
    {
      property: 'sortDescriptor',
      type: 'Object',
      description: 'The current sorted column and direction.',
      default: 'none',
    },
    {
      property: 'onSortChange',
      type: 'function',
      description: 'Handler that is called when the sort direction changes.',
      default: 'none',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Examples

### Compact variant

In this example you can see the variant `compact` from the theme b2b. It reduces the cell spacing. There is also another variant, which is called `expaned`, which enlarges the cells.
The `core-Theme` has also two variants called `tableLines` and `tableBorder`.

```tsx preview file=components/Table/table-compact.demo.tsx

```

### Selection mode single

If you have set the `selectionMode` to single, then you just can select only one row of the table.

```tsx preview file=components/Table/table-single-mode.demo.tsx

```

### Selection mode multiple

This example shows how to use the `selectionMode`, but with the setting that multiple checkboxes appear and you can select as many lines as you want.

```tsx preview file=components/Table/table-multi-mode.demo.tsx

```

### Dynamic collections

You don't have to hard code the table items, you could also create a dynamic collection and iterate through it. That's what the example shows.

```tsx preview file=components/Table/table-dynamic.demo.tsx

```

### Disabled Rows

You can also disable certain rows. For that all you have to do is add the property `disabledKeys` with the certain key to the table.

```tsx preview file=components/Table/table-disabled.demo.tsx

```

### Sorting

The options to sort are ascending or descending. For this purpose the properties (`onSortChange`, `sortDescriptor`) for sorting must be specified.

```tsx preview file=components/Table/table-sorting.demo.tsx

```

### Async sorting

In this example the `<Table>` is also sortable but its build async. For that you must use the `useAsyncList` hook. The hook manages the async list data and provides convenience methods for updating the data.

```tsx preview file=components/Table/table-async.demo.tsx

```

### Nested Columns

Columns can be nested, which will result in more than one header row to be created. Note the usage of `isRowHeader` in the example below. By default, only the first column is included in the accessibility name for each row.

```tsx preview file=components/Table/table-nested.demo.tsx

```
