## Context: what DST-1360 shipped

Branch: `DST-1360-app-shell-page-pageheader`, based on **`beta-release`** (NOT `main`, since `main` lacks
`Panel`, `useSlot`, and the document-level scroll change #5343/DST-1351, which all live on the beta line).

Single PR delivering:

- **`AppShell`**: hard rename of `AppLayout` (no alias). The three vestigial pass-throughs
  (`AppLayout.Sidebar` / `.Header` / `.Main`) are **deleted**. `<Sidebar>`, `<TopNavigation>`, `<Page>`
  are direct grid children (each already owns its `[grid-area:*]`). `AppShell` absorbs `Sidebar.Provider`
  via a flat **`defaultSidebarOpen`** prop, and passes through when an outer `Sidebar.Provider` is detected
  via `use(SidebarContext)` (escape hatch for controlled state, variant, or size). `Sidebar.Provider`
  stays exported for standalone use.
- **`Page`**: renders the `<main>` landmark, `[grid-area:main]`, owns padding (`square-relaxed`
  default, `p` / `px` / `py`) and vertical rhythm (`space`, `group` default). Does **not** own scroll
  (document scrolls) and does **not** enforce max-width (content-driven via `Panel size="form"`).
  Owns `titleId` + `useSlot` and labels `<main aria-labelledby={titleId}>`. `headingLevel` default **1**.
- **`Page.Header`** (compound member, mirrors `Panel.Header`), a pure **slot-context provider**:
  publishes `HeadingContext` (title → h1), `TextContext` (description → `<p>`), and
  `ActionButtonContext` + `ActionGroupContext` (`[grid-area:actions]`, `size: 'default'`). Consumers
  compose the shared `<Title>` / `<Description>` and slot-aware action primitives. **No** subcomponents
  of its own (no `Page.Header.Actions` wrapper, no `Page.Title`/`Page.Description`).
- **`ActionButton` gains a `primary` variant**, so the page's primary action can be the slot-aware
  `<ActionButton variant="primary">Upgrade plan</ActionButton>` inside `Page.Header`. See the
  design-system implication ticket below.

| `AppLayout` → `AppShell`                         | Hard rename, no deprecated alias (beta window)                                                                  |
| Sidebar config surface                           | Flat `defaultSidebarOpen` + external-provider pass-through (NOT a `sidebar={{}}` object yet)                    |
| `Page.Header` shape                              | Mirror `Panel.Header` exactly, compound member naming, slot provider, no wrapper                                |

### Notes / obsolete ticket assumptions

- The ticket lists "extract a shared `<Header>`/`<Title>`/`<Description>` primitive" as a **deferred
  follow-up**, but this **already shipped** on `beta-release`. `Title` and `Description` are shared
  slot-aware primitives (react-aria `HeadingContext`/`TextContext`) used by Panel, Dialog, Drawer,
  Tray, Toast. `Panel` no longer has `Panel.Title`/`Panel.Description`/`Panel.HeaderActions`. So this
  deferred item is **done**. Do not create a ticket for it.

## Follow-up tickets to create

### 1. 🧩 Design-system: clarify `<Button>` vs `<ActionButton>` now that ActionButton has `primary`

**Why now:** DST-1360 added a `primary` variant to `ActionButton` so a slot-aware action can be a page's
primary CTA inside `Page.Header`. This introduces **two routes to a primary button**: standalone
`<Button variant="primary">` and slot-configured `<ActionButton variant="primary">`. The ActionButton
docs previously stated a hard rule ("for primary, reach for `<Button>`" and "ActionButton belongs to a
surface, not the page"). That stance was softened in DST-1360 but deserves a holistic pass.
**Scope:** Decide and document the canonical distinction (standalone vs slot-configured container chrome).
Audit other slot containers (`Panel.Header`, `EmptyState`, `Dialog`/`Drawer` chrome) for whether a primary
ActionButton is appropriate there. Update `button-vs-action-button` demo + guidance. Consider whether
`Button` should eventually become slot-aware as the long-term unifier (would let `<Button>` work directly
in slot containers and possibly retire the divergence).

### 2. ✨ AppShell: skip-link

Self-contained, low risk. Add a "skip to main content" link as the first focusable element in `AppShell`,
targeting the `Page` `<main>`. Deferred from DST-1360.

### 3. ✨ Page: focus move to the page `<h1>` on route change

Needs routing integration. On client navigation, move focus to `Page.Header`'s `<Title>` (h1) so screen
reader / keyboard users land at the new page's heading. The `titleId`/`titleSlotRef` plumbing from
DST-1360 is the hook point.

### 4. ✨ AppShell: sidebar config object (`sidebar={{ … }}`)

DST-1360 ships only flat `defaultSidebarOpen` + external-provider pass-through. If demand for inline
**controlled** sidebar state (`open` / `onOpenChange`) or inline `variant` / `size` appears, add a
`sidebar={{ … }}` object prop that forwards to the absorbed provider. Designed to be added non-breakingly.

### 5. ✨ Page: loading-state convention

Needs a product decision (skeleton vs spinner vs top progress bar). Define how a `Page` represents its
loading state consistently.

### 6. ✨ Page: error-boundary convention

Bigger scope. Define the page-level error boundary / error-state pattern.

### 7. ✨ Page.Header: first-class slots (`BackAction`, `Eyebrow`, page-level `Tabs`)

Add when demand appears. For v1, page-level `Tabs` render as a sibling **below** `Page.Header`. Promote
back-action / eyebrow / tabs to first-class `Page.Header` slots if usage justifies it.

### 8. ✨ App pages: master-detail / two-column page layouts

Pattern for list+detail and other two-column page compositions inside the shell.

### 9. ✨ App pages: bottom `ActionBar` (Save / Cancel) pattern

Canonical pattern for a sticky Save/Cancel `ActionBar` at the bottom of a form page.

### 10. 📝 App pages: settings hub / landing-index page pattern

Content-design problem: how a section landing/index page is composed.

### 11. ✨ AppShell: additional shell responsibilities

Separate tickets as needed: theme-mode toggle, command menu, focus-restore after sidebar close.

### 12. 📝 / 💄 Print styles + deep-link anchors / heading-link story

Print stylesheet for app pages, and a deep-link anchor / heading-link convention for long pages.

## Research-derived follow-ups (cross-design-system survey)

Added after surveying page-layout APIs across Atlassian, Shopify Polaris, GitHub Primer, IBM Carbon,
SAP Fiori, Salesforce SLDS, Ant Design (Pro), MUI, Mantine, and Chakra. The docs PR documents the
current behavior and recipes. These are the **API-level** gaps the survey surfaced. Each is additive
(non-breaking).

### 13. ✨ Page: explicit width affordance (`width` / `narrow`)

**Finding:** _Every_ surveyed system exposes a page-level width concept. Polaris has `fullWidth` /
`narrowWidth`, Primer `containerWidth` + `Content width`, Ant `contentWidth='Fluid'|'Fixed'`,
MUI/Chakra `Container maxWidth`, and Primer names Full / Split / Interstitial page types. Marigold
deliberately has none (width is per-surface via `Panel size="form"`), now documented in the Page "Width" section.

**Decision needed:** keep per-surface-only, or add an opt-in `width`/`narrow` affordance on `Page` for
the common single-column form/settings page (so consumers don't repeat `size="form"` on every panel).
If added, mirror the `Panel size` token (`max-w-4xl`) so page-level and surface-level widths agree.

### 14. ✨ Page.Header: status / metadata placement (supersedes part of #7)

**Finding:** A status indicator next to the page title is one of the most common header features in the
field, seen in Polaris `titleMetadata`, Primer leading/trailing visuals, Carbon/Ant `tags`, and SLDS detail-row.
Marigold's `Page.Header` has exactly three grid areas (title, description, actions), so a `<Badge>` child
has no placement. The docs PR routes object status into a secondary "Overview" `<Panel>` (the detail
layout), which is a legitimate pattern, but the header slot is a real gap.

**Decision needed:** add a `titleMetadata`-style placement to `Page.Header` (a cell beside the title for
a status `<Badge>` / small metadata), or formalize the secondary-panel pattern as the only answer. Fold
into #7 (Page.Header first-class slots) when scoped.

### Note on #8 (master-detail / two-column)

The docs PR adds a **detail / record page demo** (`docs/app/(examples)/examples/venue`) and a "Common
page layouts" table in the App Shell pattern, covering the single-object detail half of #8. The master-detail
(list + detail in one view, with two scroll regions) half is still open.
