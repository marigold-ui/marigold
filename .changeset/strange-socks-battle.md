refa[DST-598]: Improve `<Slider>` component

The `<Slider>` component appears in a new guise. Functionalities and documentation have been significantly revised. So make sure to check out the Marigold documentation and storybook. It's worth it.

Some key features are:
- multithumb or range slider
- visual indicator for selected track
- use slider in forms
