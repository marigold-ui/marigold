feat[DST-731]: Add ContextualHelp Component with Docs
We added a new ContextualHelp component to provide inline help and guidance within the UI.
It displays contextual information in a popover triggered by an icon button, with configurable placement, size, and icon variant (help or info).
The component is accessible, supports both controlled and uncontrolled open states, and is designed for flexible content layout.
