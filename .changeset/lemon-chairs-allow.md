feat[DST-856]: Add TimeField Component

We added a new TimeField component to support time-based user input.
It allows users to select and edit time values, with configurable granularity (hours, minutes, seconds) and optional 12/24-hour format.
The component supports accessibility features like keyboard navigation.
