## Design Tokens

The term _design tokens_ originates from the [Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/). They are the "visual design atoms" of a design system. Similar to variables in CSS or Sass, design tokens are used to capture low-level values and then used to create the look and feel of your product. This helps with maintaining a consistent and scalable visual system for UI development.

```css
/* button.css */
.button {
  color: #1f1235;
  background: #ff6e6c;
  height: 24px;
}
```

```scss
/* colors.scss */
$color-primary: #ff6e6c;
$color-text: #1f1235;

/* sizes.scss */
$size-6: 24px;

/* button.scss */
.button {
  color: $color-text;
  background: $color-primary;
  height: $size-6;
}
```

## Rhythm & Harmony

Instead of choosing arbitrary numbers for our typography, we make use of a _modular scale_. "By using culturally relevant, historically pleasing ratios to create modular scales and basing the measurements in our compositions on values from those scales, we can achieve a visual harmony not found in layouts that use arbitrary, conventional, or easily divisible numbers." ([_More Meaningful Typography_](https://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography/))

Applied to web typography, this means we choose a base font size and apply a ratio to it. The ratio is then squared to generate an ascending scale.

```scss
/* perfect fifth */
$ratio: 1.5;

/* browser default */
$base: 16px;

/**
 * The formular is always "$base * $ratio ** $level", the level is a integer.
 * The resulting value is usually rounded to avoid poor sub-pixel rendering.
 *
 * Note that in the below example the number is not equal to the $level in
 * the formula.
 */
$fontSize-0: 10px;
$fontSize-1: 16px;
$fontSize-2: 24px;
$fontSize-3: 36px;
/* etc.  */
```

A similar concept can be applied to spacing and sizing of elements. To maintain a aesthetically pleasing rhythm between elements, we adopt the _8pt grid_. This means that multiples of 8 are used to define dimensions, paddings and margins. As a result, all of our measurements follow the same rule and we automatically get a more consistent UI.

```scss
/* 8pt grid */
$size-0: 0px;
$size-1: 8px;
$size-2: 16px;
$size-3: 32px;
$size-4: 64px;
$size-5: 128px;
$size-6: 256px;
$size-7: 512px;
```
