# \_propTableTypes directory

This directory is a workaround for using compound components like in the table because react-docgen-typescript can't
solve types from compound components. It is used by the script `build-component-props.mjs` to generate the correct type.
Then this type can be used in the props table.

## File name

Create a file with the name of the compound component part e.g `Table.Body`.

## import type

Import the type which can't be autogenerated. Normally it is the type which belongs to the compound component part
e.g. `Table.Cell = <b>Cell</b>;`

`import { Cell as ReactAriaCell } from '@react-stately/table';`

Note: You should use an alias. Name it whatever you want.

## export type

Finally export the imported type.

`export const Cell = ReactAriaCell;`

## run script

After creating the file with the content run `pnpm buil-component-props`. Then search for the file name in `props.json`
and you should find the type.

## using in prop table

Use the new type in the props table. For this just pass the file name into the component prop e.g.
`<PropsTable component="Table.Cell" />`
