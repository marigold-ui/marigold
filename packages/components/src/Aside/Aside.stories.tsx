            Pugs were originally bred to be lapdogs for Chinese royalty. They
            lived in luxury with the emperor, his family, and members of the
            imperial court. They were royal and loyal companions, and were
            highly valued in society.

          <p>
            Pugs were most likely originally bred as lapdogs for Chinese
            monarchs and were originally known as the lo-chiang-sze or the foo
            dog. It is unclear as to how long ago the breed actually first
            appeared. Some believe that Pugs date back to the Han and Tang
            Dynasties, around 150 BCE, whereas others place the date back even
            further to the Shang Dynasty, around 400 BCE (Pug).
