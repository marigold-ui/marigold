Themes are used to define the visual appearance of the application and adhere the coporate identity.

In Marigold a theme is a plain object that defines [design tokens](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/) for the context in which it should be used (e.g. B2B or B2C), including a color palette, the typography, scales for white space and size related values. A theme also comes with styles for the app's components.

Marigold's themes are based on the [Theme UI's Theme Specification](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec/) with the addition of styles for all components (`theme.<component name>`).

## Using an existing theme

There are currently two themes available:

- **B2B**: The default theme for B2B use cases.
- **Core**: The theme for applications that life inside Reservix CORE application.

To install a theme you can use the following command:

```bash onlyCode
    yarn add @marigold/theme-<lowercease theme name>
```

Afterwards pass the `theme` to the `<MarigoldProvider>`:

```jsx onlyCode
import React from 'react';
import { MarigoldProvider } from '@marigold/components';
import theme from '@marigold/theme-b2b';

const App = () => (
  <MarigoldProvider theme={theme}>{/* App code goes here */}</MarigoldProvider>
);
```

Most themes are also using custom fonts. How you do make them available for your users depends on your setup ([CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/), [`next.js`](https://nextjs.org/), ...).

The URL to load the fonts can be imported via the respective theme package. The following examples shows how to load fonts in a `next.js` app. This also supports the [font optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) feature of `next.js`:

```jsx onlyCode
// pages/_document.js

import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';
import { webFontUrl } from '@marigold/theme-b2b';

class MyDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head>
          {webFontUrl.map(url => (
            <link key={url} rel="stylesheet" href={url} />
          ))}
        </Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}

export default MyDocument;
```

In other setup you might need to use [`react-helmet`](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) or can paste the fonts directly into the `<head>` of your HTML.
