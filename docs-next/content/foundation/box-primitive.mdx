# Box Primitive

## Box as Layout Component

As the basis of all our components, we use the `<Box>`. It is a versatile component that
can be modified with style props as listed in the [Box component](../../components/box) description.
Additionally, use the `variant` prop to define custom styles in your themes. With the `as` prop, you
determine the rendered HTML element. Instead of exposing the underlying tools that will create CSS, the `<Box>` component
wraps them and exposes an API for applying styling to a component while respecting the rules and constraints of our design
system.

## Import and Usage

```tsx onlyCode
import { Box } from '@marigold/components';
```

Button box with backgroundColor, button variant and padding:

```tsx expandCode
<Box as="button" bg="primary" variant="button.primary" p="8px">
  Custom Button
</Box>
```

## Building a custom Component with the Box

In case you want to build your own custom component, use the `Box` as the underlying component and add
the styles accordingly. You can stack and nest multiple Box instances and build your complex component like this.

By default, the `Box` component will render a `<div />`. This might be fine most of the times, but sometimes you would
rather render a `<button>` or an `<input>` etc. To allow this, the `Box` takes the special prop called `as`, accepting
all HTML tag names as input. Don't forget to define variants. You can also define two variants in the theme.

```tsx onlyCode
export type ButtonProps = {
  variant?: string;
  size?: string;
} & ComponentPropsWithRef<'button'>;

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  variant = 'primary',
  size = 'large',
  children,
  ...props
}) => {
  return (
    <Box
      as="button"
      variant={[`button.${variant}`, `button.${size}`]}
      {...props}
    >
      <Box as="span" display="inline-flex" alignItems="center">
        {children}
      </Box>
    </Box>
  );
};
```

## Style priority order

- \_\_baseCSS
- variant
- styleProps
- css prop

## \_\_baseCSS

The `__baseCSS` prop is internal and only for writing Marigold components.
You can set component base styles which are applied on every component instance.

```tsx onlyCode
<Box
  __baseCSS={{
    display: 'flex'
    alignItems= 'center'
    justifyContent='space-between'
  }}
>
  ...
</Box>
```

## Variant

In most cases the right choice to style components for an application or a specific context is with the variant prop.
Learn more about variants and how to use them on this [page](./themes-variants).

## StyleProps

StyleProps are convenience helpers to style an instance.
Look at the [Box component](../../components/box) to see which props are usable.

```tsx onlyCode
<Box
  as="button"
  variant={`button.${variant}`}
  display="flex"
  p="16px"
  border="1px solid"
>
  ...
</Box>
```

## Custom CSS

Staying inside the boundaries of the design system and its contraints should be the norm. But as limiting styling only
to allowed values defined by the system can be very restrictive, you can use the `css` prop and generate custom
styles.

```tsx onlyCode
<Box
  as="button"
  variant={`button.${variant}`}
  css={{ fontSize: '16px', color = 'orange' }}
  {...props}
>
  ...
</Box>
```
